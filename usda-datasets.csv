The 2004 County Typology codes classify all U.S. counties according to six non-overlapping categories of economic dependence and seven overlapping categories of policy-relevant themes. The economic types include farming, mining, manufacturing, services, Federal/State government, and unspecialized counties. The policy types include housing stress, low education, low employment, persistent poverty, population loss, nonmetro recreation, and retirement destination. In addition, a code identifying counties with persistent child poverty is available.

County-level Oil and Gas Production in the U.S.,"County-level data from oil and/or natural gas producing States—for onshore production in the lower 48 States only—are compiled on a State-by-State basis.

Raw data for natural gas is for gross withdrawals, and oil data almost always include natural gas liquids. Note that State-provided natural gas withdrawals were not available for Illinois or Indiana; those estimates were produced using geocoded wells and State total production reported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Agency.

Over 1 in 4 rural children are living in families that are poor, according to the official poverty measure, up from 1 in 5 in 1999, but this change was uneven across the rural landscape. Counties with high vulnerability to child poverty, those with both low young adult education levels and high proportions of children in single-parent families, were generally the most hard-hit by the recession of the past decade and experienced substantial increases in their already high child poverty rates. Along with the recession, an increase in rural children in single-parent households, continuing from the 1990s, was a major contributor to the rise in child poverty after 2000. Three factors that shape the geography of high and increasing rural child poverty are explored below: economic conditions, young adult education levels, and family structure.

Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes,"The rural-urban commuting area codes (RUCA) classify U.S. census tracts using measures of urbanization, population density, and daily commuting from the decennial census.

The most recent RUCA codes are based on data from the 2000 decennial census. The classification contains two levels. Whole numbers (1-10) delineate metropolitan, micropolitan, small town, and rural commuting areas based on the size and direction of the primary (largest) commuting flows. These 10 codes are further subdivided to permit stricter or looser delimitation of commuting areas, based on secondary (second largest) commuting flows. The approach errs in the direction of more codes, providing flexibility in combining levels to meet varying definitional needs and preferences.
 
The 1990 codes are similarly defined. However, the Census Bureau's methods of defining urban cores and clusters changed between the two censuses. And, census tracts changed in number and shapes.

Farmers and policymakers are interested in the level of counter-cyclical payments (CCPs) provided by the 2008 Farm Act to producers of selected commodities. CCPs are based on the season-average price received by farmers. (For more information on CCPs, see the ERS 2008 Farm Bill Side-By-Side, Title I: Commodity Programs.) 
 
This data product provides three Excel spreadsheet models that use futures prices to forecast the U.S. season-average price received and the implied CCP for three major field crops (corn, soybeans, and wheat). Users can view the model forecasts or create their own forecast by inserting different values for futures prices, basis values, or marketing weights. Example computations and data are provided on the Documentation page.

#### Spreadsheet Models
 
For each of the three major U.S. field crops, the Excel spreadsheet model computes a forecast for:

1. the national-level season-average price received by farmers and
2. the implied counter-cyclical payment rate.
 
Note: the model forecasts are not official USDA forecasts. See USDA's World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates for official USDA season-average price forecasts. See USDA's Farm Service Agency information for official USDA CCP rates.","Economic Research Service, Department of Agriculture",Dana Golden,mailto:Dana.Golden@usda.gov,2020-07-10,http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/season-average-price-forecasts/,dcat:Distribution,public

"2014 Naive Broiler CAFO Study for Agricultural Antibiotic Resistance in Mississippi State, Mississippi","<p>2014 Naive Broiler CAFO Study for Agricultural Antibiotic Resistance in Mississippi State, Mississippi<br />
Conventional commercial broiler production involves the rearing of more than 20,000 broilers in a single confined space, atop bedding material such as pine shavings or rice hulls, for approximately 6.5 weeks. This environment is known for harboring pathogens and antibiotic resistant bacteria, but studies have focused on previously established houses. A concerted effort by the broiler industry has involved the scaling back of antibiotic use on-farm, but this has only been a recent occurrence. In the current study, a set of three naïve houses were followed from inception through 11 broiler flocks and monitored for ambient climatic conditions, bacterial pathogens, and antibiotic resistance. Within the first 3 weeks of the first flock cycle, 100% of litter samples were positive for Salmonella and Listeria while Campylobacter was culture negative. In all likelihood, given that pre flock bedding and soil levels were negative for pathogens and 4-5 orders of magnitude lower for other indicators, chicks most likely provided the colonizing bacteria. The influence of intra-house location was minor with only watering lines and side walls influencing some pathogen and indicator levels. Most bacterial groups experienced the typical cyclical pattern of litter contamination seen in other studies. This study represents a first of its kind view into the time required for bacterial pathogens and antibiotic resistance to colonize and establish in naïve broiler houses.</p>

"2014 Swine CAFO Study SE for Agricultural Antibiotic Resistance in Mississippi State, Mississippi","<p>2014 Swine CAFO Study SE for Agricultural Antibiotic Resistance in Mississippi State, Mississippi<br />
The environmental influence of farm management in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFO) can yield vast changes to the microbial biota and ecological structure of both the pig and waste manure lagoon wastewater.  While some of these changes may not be negative, it is possible that CAFOs can enrich antibiotic resistant bacteria or pathogens based on farm type, thereby influencing the impact imparted by the land application of its respective wastewater.  The purpose of this study was to measure the microbial constituents of swine-sow, -nursery, and -finisher farm manure lagoon wastewater and determine the changes induced by farm management.  A total of 37 farms were visited in the Mid-South USA and analyzed for the genes 16S rRNA, spaQ (Salmonella spp.), Camp-16S (Campylobacter spp.), tetA, tetB, ermF, ermA, mecA, and intI using quantitative PCR.  Additionally, 16S rRNA sequence libraries were created.  Overall, it appeared that finisher farms were significantly different from nursery and sow farms in nearly all genes measured and in 16S rRNA clone libraries.  Nearly all antibiotic resistance genes were detected in all farms.  Interestingly, the mecA resistance gene (e.g. methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus) was below detection limits on most farms, and decreased as the pigs aged.  Finisher farms generally had fewer antibiotic resistance genes, which corroborated previous phenotypic data; additionally, finisher farms produced a less diverse 16S rRNA sequence library.  Comparisons of Camp-16S and spaQ GU (genomic unit) values to previous culture data demonstrated ratios from 10 to 10,000:1 depending on farm type, indicating viable but not cultivatable bacteria were dominant.  The current study indicated that swine farm management schemes positively and negatively affect microbial and antibiotic resistant populations in CAFO wastewater which has future “downstream” implications from both an environmental and public health perspective.</p>

2DSOIL version 03,"<p>2D finite element water, solute, and heat mover model for plant models.</p>
<p>Most crops are grown in rows and this introduces spatial variability in soil processes with respect to the row. However, this variability can be exploited to reduce chemical transport to groundwater or improve management of irrigation water. Unless a model can account for variability perpendicular to crop rows as well as vertically into the soil profile it will not be able to fully evaluate all possible management practices that can be used to make agriculture more efficient and less harmful to the environment. To address this concern we developed 2DSOIL, the first comprehensive, modular, two-dimensional soil simulator that can simulate the major physical, chemical and biological processes in soil. Fully implemented, principles of modular modeling facilitate the addition and replacement of modules, as well as the reuse of existing code. The modularity of 2DSOIL has been designed to make it easy to modify the model and to make it easy to incorporate into plant models. 2DSOIL was used to simulate the effect of several water and nitrogen management practices and was incorporated into ARS potato and cotton models, into the Root Zone Water Quality Model, and into the USGS Modular Modeling System.</p>

3DADE,"<p>3DADE is a Fortran computer program for evaluating a series of analytical solutions of the 3-Dimensional Advection-Dispersion Equation. The analytical solutions pertain to three-dimensional solute transport during steady unidirectional water flow in porous media with uniform transport and flow properties. The transport equation contains terms accounting for solute movement by advection and dispersion, as well as for solute retardation, first-order decay, and zero-order production.  The3DADE code can be used to solve the direct problem, i.e., the concentration is calculated as a function of time and space for specified model parameters, and the indirect (inverse) problem in which the program estimates selected parameters by fitting one of the analytical solutions to specified experimental data. Transient analytical solutions are evaluated for five different transport scenarios (three boundary value problems and two initial value problems) in either a Cartesian or cylindrical coordinate system. Simple steady-state solutions are also provided for three initial value problems.</p>

"ACRE Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in West Lafayette, Indiana","<p>ACRE Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in West Lafayette, Indiana<br />
In-field measurements of direct soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions provide critical data for quantifying the net energy efficiency and economic feasibility of crop residue based bioenergy production systems. A major challenge to such assessments has been the paucity of field studies addressing the effects of crop residue removal and associated best practices for soil management (i.e., conservation tillage) on soil emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4). This regional survey summarizes soil GHG emissions from nine maize production systems evaluating different levels of corn stover removal under conventional or conservation tillage management across the US Corn Belt. Cumulative growing season soil emissions of CO2, N2O, and/ or CH4 were measured for 2–5 years (2008–2012) at these various sites using a standardized static vented chamber technique as part of the USDA-ARS’s Resilient Economic Agricultural Practices (REAP) regional partnership. Cumulative soil GHG emissions during the growing season varied widely across sites, by management, and by year. Overall, corn stover removal decreased soil total CO2 and N2O emissions by -4 and -7 %, respectively, relative to no removal. No management treatments affected soil CH4 fluxes.When aggregated to total GHG emissions (Mg CO2eq ha-1) across all sites and years, corn stover removal decreased growing season soil emissions by -5±1 % (mean±se) and ranged from -36 % to 54 % (n=50). Lower GHG emissions in stover removal treatments were attributed to decreased C and N inputs into soils, as well as possible microclimatic differences associated with changes in soil cover. High levels of spatial and temporal variabilities in direct GHG emissions highlighted the importance of site-specific management and environmental conditions on the dynamics of GHG emissions from agricultural soils.</p>

AGWA - Automated Geospatial Watershed Assessment Tool,"<p>The Automated Geospatial Watershed Assessment (AGWA) tool is a GIS-based hydrologic modeling tool that uses commonly available GIS data layers to fully parameterize, execute, and spatially visualize results for the RHEM, KINEROS2, KINEROS-OPUS, SWAT2000, and SWAT2005 watershed runoff and erosion models. Accommodating novice to expert GIS users, it is designed to be used by watershed, water resource, land use, and resource managers and scientists investigating the hydrologic impacts of land-cover/land-use change in small watershed to basin-scale studies. AGWA is currently available as AGWA 1.5 for ArcView 3.x, AGWA 2.x for ArcGIS 9.x, and AGWA 3.X for ArcGIS 10.x.</p>
<p>Planning and assessment in land and water resource management are evolving from simple, local-scale problems toward complex, spatially explicit regional ones. Such problems have to be addressed with distributed models that can compute runoff and erosion at different spatial and temporal scales. The extensive data requirements and the difficult task of building input parameter files, however, have long represented an obstacle to the timely and cost-effective use of such complex models by resource managers.</p>
<p>The USDA- ARS Southwest Watershed Research Center, in cooperation with the U.S. EPA Office of Research and Development Landscape Ecology Branch, the University of Arizona, and the University of Wyoming, has developed a GIS tool to facilitate this process. A geographic information system (GIS) provides the framework within which spatially-distributed data are collected and used to prepare model input files and evaluate model results.</p>

AROP,"<p>Accurate geo-referencing information is a basic requirement for combining remote satellite imagery with other geographic information. To detect changes in time-series satellite images, it is extremely important for the images to be precisely co-registered and orthorectified, so that images acquired from different sensors and dates can be compared directly.</p>
<p>Precise registration relates satellite images to the ground reference based on carefully selected ground control points between the image and corresponding ground objects. Co-registration matches two images based on the tie points in the images. The topographical variations of the earth’s surface and the satellite view zenith angle affect the pixel’s distance projected onto the satellite image. The distortion inherent in the image is determined by topographical elevation. The orthorectification process is used to correct the pixel displacement caused by the topographical variations at the off-nadir viewing and to make the image orthographic, with every pixel in its correct location regardless of elevation and viewing direction.</p>
<p>The automated registration and orthorectification package (AROP) uses precisely registered and orthorectified Landsat data (e.g., GeoCover or recently released free Landsat Level 1T data from the USGS EROS data center) as the base image to co-register, orthorectify and reproject (if needs) the warp images from other data sources, and thus make geo-referenced time-series images consistent in the geographic extent, spatial resolution, and projection. The co-registration, orthorectification and reprojection processes were integrated and thus image is only resampled once. This package has been tested on the Landsat Multi-spectral Scanner (MSS), TM, Enhanced TM Plus (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager (OLI), Terra ASTER, CBERS CCD, IRS-P6 AWiFS, and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data.</p>
<p>The development of the AROP package was supported by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat Science Team project and the NASA EOS project. The package was initially developed at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center by Dr. Feng Gao (from September 2005 to June 2011).

ARS-Media,"<p>Understanding the ion-specific effects of the mineral elements is a central theme of biology because these ions are fundamental to the composition and maintenance of life. However, experiments concerned with determining ion-specific effects are generally performed with salt, as opposed to ion, manipulations. This means that researchers have had to accept a co-variance in the co-ion of the salt used to manipulate the ion of interest. The result is that the effect of a single ion cannot be determined as it is confounded with the potential combined effects of the other ions that are co-varied. Because of this difficulty, the majority of research studies concerned with determining ion-specific effects exhibit ion confounding.  The software application ARS-Media utilizes a linear programming optimization algorithm to determine the combination of salts, acids, and bases that satisfies any given target solution of ions.  ARS-Media therefore allows researchers to construct experimental designs that use ions, as opposed to salts, as individual factors and, hence, experimentally determine ion-specific effects on biological responses relating to ion type, concentration, and proportion.</p>
<p>ARS-Media for Excel is an ion solution calculator that uses Excel's linear programming optimization add-in Solver.</p>
<p>ARS-Media utilizes Excel’s internal linear programming optimization algorithm to determine the combination of salts, acids, and bases that satisfy any given target solution of ions.  The spreadsheet is designed for the formulation of nutrient media used in such applications as plant tissue culture, hydroponics, algal culture, fertilizer formulations, microbial culture, and any application that requires the definition of a specific culture media by its ion composition.  The spreadsheet is formula-based and uses no macros that can sometimes conflict with institutional IT security systems.</p>

"ASRU Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Sidney, Montana","<p>Information is needed to mitigate dryland soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by using novel management practices. We evaluated the effects of cropping sequence and N fertilization on dryland soil temperature and water content at the 0- to 15-cm depth and surface CO2, N2O, and CH4 fluxes in a Williams loam in eastern Montana. Treatments were no-tilled continuous malt barley (Hordeum vulgaris L.) (NTCB), no-tilled malt barley-pea (Pisum sativum L.) (NTB-P), and conventional-tilled malt barley-fallow (CTB-F) (control), each with 0 and 80 kg N ha-1. Gas fluxes were measured at 3 to 14 d intervals using static, vented chambers from March to November, 2008 to 2011. Soil temperature varied but water content was greater in CTB-F than in other treatments. The GHG fluxes varied with date of sampling, peaking immediately after substantial precipitation (&gt;15 mm) and N fertilization during increased soil temperature. Total CO2 flux from March to November was greater in NTCB and NTB-P with 80 kg N ha-1 than in other treatments from 2008 to 2010. Total N2O flux was greater in NTCB with 0 kg N ha-1 and in NTB-P with 80 kg N ha-1 than in other treatments in 2008 and 2011. Total CH4 uptake was greater with 80 than with 0 kg N ha-1 in NTCB in 2009 and 2011. Because of intermediate level of CO2 equivalent of GHG emissions and known favorable effect on malt barley yield, NTB-P with 0 kg N ha-1 might mitigate GHG emissions and sustain crop yields compared to other treatments in eastern Montana. For accounting global warming potential of management practices, however, additional information on soil C dynamics and CO2 associated with production inputs and machinery use are needed.</p>

AgAR (Agricultural Antibiotic Resistance),"<p>An Environmental Component of a ""One Health"" approach, the mission of the Agricultural Antibiotic Resistance (AgAR) project is to</p>
<ul>
<li>develop practical tools and protocols to measure antibiotic drugs, resistant bacteria and resistance genes in agriculturally-impacted soil, water, air, and food;</li>
<li>design and evaluate agricultural best management practices to limit the persistence and spread of antibiotic resistance from agroecosystems;</li>
<li>facilitate sharing of ideas and resources among ARS scientists by establishing an agency-wide network of researchers with the common goal of conducting science-based research on AgAR topics.</li>
</ul>
<p>ANTIBIOTIC DRUGS: Which drugs are the most relevant for each type of ag production system?  At what level do excreted drugs continue to provide selective pressure in the environment?</p>
<p>RESISTANT BACTERIA: What is the relative contribution of specific bacteria to resistance in human clinical settings?  Are some bacteria more likely than others to donate or receive resistance genes?  What is the relative contribution of clonal spread of pathogens versus horizontal gene transfer?</p>
<p>RESISTANT GENES: How long do specific types of genes persist in agricultural samples?  What conditions increase or decrease the likelihood of a successful transfer in manure, soil, water, and air?  What is the role of the natural soil ""resistome""?</p>
<p>AgAR Network Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect ARS researchers at multiple locations in order to develop and assess methods for measuring resistance that are robust, and that are validated across production systems and geographical areas.</li>
<li>Identify which types of resistance are relevant to measure, based on an understanding of individual production systems and prioritized human health threats as identified by WHO and CDC</li>
<li>Encourage the collection of baseline data and control samples so that the impact of agricultural best management practices can be accurately determined.</li>
<li>Assess persistence of antibiotic drugs, resistant bacteria and resistance genes in environmental and pre-harvest settings.</li>
<li>Long term goal: Discover the details of how, and at what rate bacteria and genes move back and forth between animals and humans through agricultural systems (soil, water, air wildlife, insects, and food).</li>
</ul>
<p>The AgAR network is composed of ARS scientists with an interest in understanding the ecology of antibiotic resistance in soil, water, air, insects, wildlife, and food. The network currently represents 4 national programs at 10 ARS locations across the United States, with over 200 peer-reviewed publications on AgAR topics, authored and co-authored by over 70 current and former ARS employees.</p>
<p>Activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facilitate routine communication between AgAR members to address priority research areas, encourage agency and location wide collaboration and minimize research overlap.</li>
<li>Establish a framework for the cross-laboratory validation of AgAR methods.</li>
<li>Serve as a resource to scientists, stakeholders and administrators on current and past projects that address AgAR.</li>
<li>Provide a point of contact for agency coordinators to solicit information and transmit agency goals to relevant research groups.</li>
</ul>
<p>Importance:</p>
<p>While there is broad agreement the use of antibiotics in food animals has the potential to adversely impact human clinical outcomes, the details of how this happens are unknown, and there is a critical need for information on antibiotic resistance (AR) in agricultural settings (AgAR).  U.S. and international health organizations have taken the lead on identifying specific antibiotic drugs and resistant infections that are critical to human health. ARS is uniquely positioned to provide information on the ""farm"" side of the ""farm to fork continuum"". ARS scientists are able to address these questions in a practical way, by combining their experience (over 200 peer-reviewed ARS publications on antibiotic resistance) with their applied understanding of agricultural production systems.</p>
<p>ORGANIZATION: Scientists work on their own, individual research projects. The AgAR network provides resources to participants to encourage collaboration across program areas and geographical location.</p>
<p>MANAGEMENT: The AgAR network is operated using a wiki community approach. All participating scientists are encouraged to contribute to and share in the community resources.   Currently, the group resources will be curated by the group coordinator, with input and guidance from a five person advisory panel.</p>

Agricultural Conservation Planning Framework (ACPF) Database,"<p>Spatial data on soils, land use, and topography, combined with knowledge of conservation effectiveness can be used to identify alternatives to reduce nutrient discharge from small watersheds. This database was developed to be used in conjunction with the Agricultural Conservation Planning Framework Toolkit.</p>
<p>Data comprise soil survey information and land use. Soil characterization data were extracted from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Web Soil Survey (Soil Survey Staff, 2013). Land use coverages were developed to represent agricultural fields and the types and rotations of agricultural crops and other land cover types. Land use boundaries were produced by editing a publicly available USDA field boundaries dataset (pre-2008), with all ownership and county-level attributes removed. To ensure these field polygons were consistent with recent land use, the 2009 Cropland Data Layer (USDA-NASS, 2013) was examined for all fields larger than 16 ha. For those fields with multiple cover types, 2009 National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) aerial photography was used as a basis to manually edit field boundaries. A field was considered to have multiple cover types and was edited if the dominant cover occupied &lt;75% of the field, as indicated by the 2009 Cropland Data Layer. Updated field boundaries were then overlaid with data from USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Service (2013) Cropland Data Layer for 2000 – 2014, and each field was classified to represent crop rotations and land cover using the most recent six-year (2009-2014) sequence of land cover.  Six-year land-cover strings (e.g., corn-corn-soybean-corn-soybean-corn) generated for each field were classified to represent major crop rotations, which were dominantly comprised of corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr) annual row crops.</p>
<p>The database does not include high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from LiDAR (light detection and ranging) survey data, although these are needed by the Agricultural Conservation Planning Framework Toolkit and must be obtained independently.</p>
<p>Database is scheduled to become available on October 1, 2015.</p>

Agricultural Conservation Planning Framework (ACPF) Toolbox,"<p>Spatial data on soils, land use, and topography combined with knowledge of conservation effectiveness can be used to reduce nutrient discharge from small watersheds.</p>
<p>The Agricultural Conservation Planning Framework (ACPF) Toolbox software includes tools to process the LiDAR-based digital elevation models for hydrologic analysis, which then allows a series of prioritization, riparian classification, and conservation-practice placement tools to be used. These toolsets identify agricultural fields most prone to deliver runoff directly to streams, map and classify riparian zones to inform whole-watershed riparian corridor management, and estimate the extent of tile drainage in the watershed. The software maps out suites of locations appropriate to install each of several types of conservation practices. These practice-placement opportunities are mapped for practices including controlled drainage, grassed waterways, water and sediment control basins, and nutrient removal wetlands. Rather than making any recommendations, ACPF provides an inventory of watershed assessment data and conservation placement opportunities across a watershed, in order to inform local watershed planning.</p>
<p>ACPF software runs as an extension to ArcGIS software (ver 10.2 or higher) and requires the customized ACPF spatial databases that include agricultural field boundaries and land uses, key soil survey information, and LiDAR based elevation data that are all tied to the Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 12 watershed scale.</p>

Agricultural Land Management Alternative with Numerical Assessment Criteria (ALMANAC) Simulation Model,"<p>The Agricultural Land Management Alternative with Numerical Assessment Criteria (ALMANAC) model simulates crop growth, competition, light interception by leaves, biomass accumulation, partitioning of biomass into grain, water use, nutrient uptake, and growth constraints such as water, temperature, and nutrient stress. Plant development is temperature driven, with duration of growth stages dependent on degree days. Each plant species has a defined base temperature and optimum temperature. The simulation of competition for light is based on Beer's law, allowing a different extinction coefficient (k) for each species. Light is partitioned between species based on k-values, leaf area index (LAI) and plant heights. LAI, light interception with Beer's law, and potential daily biomass increase with a species-specific value of radiation use efficiency (RUE). The model simulates competition for water and nutrients based on each species' current rooting zone and demand by each species. The daily increases in and biomass are reduced when plant-available water in the current rooting depth is insufficient to meet potential evapotranspiration. Total biomass is simulated with radiation use efficiency and grain yield with a harvest index approach, sensitive to water stress. Grain yield is simulated based on harvest index (HI), which is the grain yield as a fraction of the total aboveground dry matter at maturity.</p>
<p>Simulations using the BatchRun section of ALMANAC will create outputs for more than one scenario at a time. BatchRuns allow ALMANAC users to perform many runs at a time. For an example of BatchRun in use, see Dr. Behrman's '<a href=""https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/12-0436.1"">Spatial forecasting of switchgrass productivity under current and future climate change scenarios</a>' with simulations across the eastern half of the United States.</p>
<p>Soil, weather, tillage, and crop parameter are essential inputs for the model. Users typically access the extensive NRCS soils data, and readily available daily weather data, such as NOAA, for inputs. See HowtoSoils and NOAAfiles for downloading and ALMANAC formatting instructions. Weather inputs require values of daily maximum and minimum temperatures, rainfall, and solar radiation. ALMANAC contains a weather generator subroutine, based on concepts of the WGEN model. The generator is used when weather is not available, or the user does not wish to use or format existing data. Users can make runs with several years of weather in a few minutes, enabling them to efficiently simulate an extensive range of management, crop, and soil scenarios. Tillage requires users to select or create management data. ALMANAC offers a wide range of tillage operations including drainage, irrigation, fertilization, furrow diking, and liming. We recommend obtaining field data to gain parameters for new plants, or yield data of established plants to calibrate and validate simulations. Parameters for describing plant processes are easy to derive for a plant species or cultivar (see Sampling Protocol Standard with Photos). After parameters for describing plant processes are derived for a plant species or cultivar they are easily transfer among the models here in Temple (EPIC, APEX, SWAT).</p>
<p>ALMANAC is an important decision making tool with proven parameters and simulations that have been applied to many crop prediction and natural resource problems. ALMANAC can assist with future crop predictions such as how much biomass will be produced, what plant will be successful where, when is the optimal time to harvest, the effect of management on competing species, and management adjustment effects on land. ALMANAC is also used in natural resources regarding climate change, soil erosion, risk assessment, management decisions, plant competition, conservation effects and climate change on soil, water, competition. With this model users can determine how a plant will yield across time, how nutrients and water pass through the system, and how plants will be affected by management changes. We input real world field data into plant parameters used for the model, this enables our simulations to be more precise. The model has been used in nationwide assessments, ecosystem studies, biofuels, and for individual farmer fields.</p>
<p>ALMANAC has also been developed for Mexico. The ALMANACMEX  model is an output of  research collaboration between  the United States Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) and the  Mexican National Institute of Agricultural, Forestry and Livestock Research (INIFAP).</p>

To support these goals, it has been necessary to develop planning approaches, high-resolution spatial datasets, and conservation practice assessment tools that will allow the agricultural and conservation communities to characterize and mitigate these challenges. The field boundary dataset represents a spatial framework for assembling and maintaining geospatial data to support conservation planning at the scale where conservation practices are implemented.</p>
<p>This field boundaries dataset has been assembled to support field-scale agricultural conservation planning using the USDA/ARS Agricultural Conservation Planning Framework (ACPF). The original data used to create this database are the pre-2008 Farm Bill FSA common land unit (CLU) datasets. A portion of metadata found herein pertains to the USDA FSA CLU. The remaining information has been developed to reflect the repurposing of the data in its aggregated form. It is important to note that all USDA programmatic and ownership information that was associated with the original data have been removed. Beyond that, these data has been extensively edited to reflect crop-specific land use consistent with 2009 land cover as derived from 2009 NASS Crop Data Layer datasets and 2009 aerial photography, and no longer reflects discrete ownership patterns.</p>
<p>The ACPF field boundaries feature class incorporates two additional resources that form the Upper Mississippi River Basin (UMRB) ACPF Land Use database. The UMRB ACPF Fields Crop History table holds the dominant land use class, derived from the NASS CDL, for individual fields from 2010 to 2020. The UMRB ACPF Land Use table hold summary land use information for individual fields for 2015 to 2020 including an assigned General Land Use (GenLU) that represent the cropping system over that period. In lieu of a data dictionary for these resources, each dataset has a FGDC-compliant metadata file using the North American ISO 19115-2003 profile in .xml format.</p>

Agricultural land use by field: Wisconsin 2010-2019,"<p>Improving the quality of water discharged from agricultural watersheds requires comprehensive and adaptive approaches for planning and implementing conservation practices. These measures will need to consider landscape hydrology, distributions of soil types, land cover, and crop distributions in an integrated manner.

AgroEcosystem Performance Assessment Tool,"<p>The AgroEcosystem Performance Assessment Tool is a computer program used to evaluate the agronomic and environmental performance of management practices in long-term agroecosystem experiments.  The program employs a simple scoring method to quantify the performance of management practices using indicators grouped within agroecosystem functions.  Management practices are evaluated on a relative basis using the method, thereby internalizing comparisons.  Because of its specialized application to long-term experiments, the program is designed primarily for use by agricultural researchers.</p>

"Agronomic Calendars for the Bushland, Texas Cotton Datasets","<p>This dataset consists of agronomic calendars for each growing season (year) when upland cotton [<em>Gossypium hirsutum</em> (L.)] was grown for fiber and seed at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU) research weather station, Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). In 2000, 2001, 2008, 2020, and 2021, cotton was grown on four large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. In 2002, 2010, and 2012, cotton was grown on two large, precision weighing lysimeters and their surrounding 4.44 ha square fields. In 2003 and 2004, cotton was grown on only one large weighing lysimeter in rotation with sorghum. The four fields were contiguous. The fields were designated northeast (NE), southeast (SE), northwest (NW), and southwest (SW), and were themselves arranged in a larger square with the fields in four adjacent quadrants of the larger square. Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system in from 2000 through 2012. In 2020 and 2021, the NE and SE fields were irrigated using subsurface drip irrigation (SDI), while the NW and SW fields were irrigated using a linear move system. Cotton was sometimes grown as a dryland crop, sometimes as a fully irrigated crop, and sometimes as a deficit irrigated crop. Irrigations designated as full were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe to 2.4-m depth in the field. Irrigations designated as deficit typically involved full irrigation to establish the crop. A crop calendar for each season lists by date the pertinent agronomic and maintenance operations (e.g., planting, thinning, fertilization, pesticide application, lysimeter maintenance, harvest). For each season there is one crop calendar for each two lysimeters (NE and SE, and/or NW and SW).<br />
    These datasets originate from research aimed at determining crop water use (ET), crop coefficients for use in ET-based irrigation scheduling based on a reference ET, crop growth, yield, harvest index, and crop water productivity as affected by irrigation method, timing, amount (full or some degree of deficit), agronomic practices, cultivar, and weather. Prior publications have focused on ET, crop coefficients, and crop water productivity. Crop coefficients have been used by ET networks. The data have utility for testing simulation models of crop ET, growth, and yield and have been used for testing, and calibrating models of ET that use satellite and/or weather data.</p>

Alfalfa flux footprint experiment 2021,"<p>Four eddy-covariance (EC) sensors were deployed at two heights upwind and within alfalfa plot trials at San Joaquin Valley Ag Science Center.  The purpose of the experiment was to evaluate the robustness of flux footprint models under different atmospheric stability conditions.  At each of the two locations, an EC sensor was mounted at an unconventionally low height (~1 meter) and a second at a more typical height (~2.5 m).  Supplementary sensors were co-located to measure net radiation, soil heat flux, and other parameters necessary to evaluate closure of the surface energy budget.  The southeast station was located at the downwind edge of  a 2 acre plot trial of irrigated alfalfa, arranged in small blocks.  The upwind fetch (with respect to predominant day time wind direction) included less than 100 meters of semi-homogeneous conditions.  Soil sensors were duplicated across the alfalfa blocks and inter-block alleys which were irrigated but not planted.  The northwest station was located approximately 25 meters upwind of the irrigated alfalfa plot trials in fallow, non-irrigated bare field.<br />
Raw 10 Hz infrared gas analyzer and sonic anemometer data, and 30 minute averaged data from other sensors are provided.</p>

"Alternative Biomass Production Study for Resilient Economic Agricultural Practices in Morris, Minnesota","<p>Alternative Biomass Production Study for Resilient Economic Agricultural Practices in Morris, Minnesota<br />
The Tillage Study was established in 1997 to assess the effect of a variety of tillage intensities on soil C. The initial eight treatments included no-tillage, moldboard + disk tillage, chisel tillage, and fall and spring residue management, with or without strip-tillage and strip-tillage + subsoiling (Archer and Reicosky, 2009). In 2004, treatments were reduced to no-tillage, moldboard tillage, and fall and spring residue management without strip-tillage, but all had an early or late planting date. The last comprehensive set of soil samples were collected in 2006. In 2008, the strip-tilled subset of the Tillage Study plots were repurposed for the Alternative Biomass Production Systems study, which was designed to explore alternative strategies to support bioenergy including planting of cellulosic feedstock. The Alternative Biomass Production plots included perennials in an extended 6-year rotation, winter cereal rye cover crops in a corn-soybean rotation, and an alternative Sorghum-Sudan grass hybrid forage system, all of which have and will continue to be monitored for agronomic and soil properties.</p>

"AmeriFlux ecosystem observation datasets - University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Agricultural Research Service irrigated continuous maize site","<p>The study site is one of three fields (all located within 1.6 km of each other) at the University of Nebraska Agricultural Research and Development Center near Mead, Nebraska. This site is irrigated with a center pivot system. Prior to the initiation of the study, the irrigated site had a 10-yr history of maize-soybean rotation under no-till. A tillage operation (disking) was done just prior to the 2001 planting to homogenize the top 0.1 m of soil, incorporate P and K fertilizers, as well as previously accumulated surface residues. Since the tillage operation, the site has been under no-till management until the harvest of 2005. Following harvest, a conservation-plow tillage operation was initiated where a small amount of N fertilizer is sprayed on the residue immediately prior to the plow operation. Approximately 1/3 of the crop residue is left on the surface. The post-harvest conservation-plow operation continues as the current practice.</p>

Animal Germplasm Resources Information Network (A-GRIN),"<p>Animal genetic resources underpin the livestock sector's production and profitability. As a result livestock industries contribute billions of dollars to national economies. The Animal Germplasm Resources Information Network (A-GRIN) mission is to acquire, evaluate and preserve these strategic resources so that industry and the research community can have access to a broad array of genetic variability for: national security, introduction of genetic variation, corrective breeding, and various research initiatives. There are three major technical components:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information Systems</strong> to better understand genetic diversity in the collection of germplasm and live populations.</li>
<li><strong>Genetic Evaluation</strong> - understanding genetic diversity for the collection of germplasm and live populations.</li>
<li><strong>Cryobiology</strong>, the discipline that enables the program to store gametes and various tissues at ultra-low temperatures (about -196°C).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition this program interacts with a wide range of livestock producers, researchers, and various industry representatives. Users can drill down to explore the germplasm collection by species, breed, line, and individual; compare taxonomies; find animals that meet their criteria to make a germplasm request.</p>

"Annual ground-based photographs taken at 15 net primary production (NPP) study sites at Jornada Basin LTER, 1996-ongoing","<p>This data package contains a list of ground-based photographs taken at fifteen Net Primary Production (NPP) study sites at the Jornada Basin LTER. Sites were selected to represent the 5 major ecosystem types in the Chihuahuan Desert (upland grasslands, playa grasslands, mesquite-dominated shrublands, creosotebush-dominated shrublands, tarbush-dominated shrublands). For each ecosystem type, three sites were selected to represent the range in variability in production and plant diversity; thus the locations are not replicates. At each site, a 1 hectare area was fenced in 1988 and a grid of 49 (48 at one playa location) 1m x 1m replicate quadrats was laid out when vegetation sampling began in 1989. Beginning in 1996, annual photos were taken from each of the 4 corners of each of the 15 70-meter x 70-meter NPP sites between August and November, depending on other research activity constraints. From 1996-2002 photos were taken using 35mm color slide film. Beginning in 2003, digital photos were taken in JPG format. Occasionally, supplemental photos may be taken at the same time that provide additional habitat information at the landscape, patch, or plant species level. No photographs were taken in 2013. Photo files (.jpeg format) are included in annual ZIP archives attached to this data package. This is an ongoing dataset that is updated once per year.</p>

"Annual mean estimates of aboveground net primary production (NPP) at 15 sites at Jornada Basin LTER, 1989-ongoing","<p>This package contains values of mean annual aboveground net primary production (NPP, in grams per square meter per year) at 15 NPP study sites on Jornada Experimental Range (JER) and Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) lands. Sites were selected to represent the 5 major ecosystem types in the Chihuahuan Desert (upland grasslands, playa grasslands, mesquite-dominated shrublands, creosotebush-dominated shrublands, tarbush-dominated shrublands). For each ecosystem type, three sites were selected to represent the range in variability in production and plant diversity; thus the locations are not replicates. At each site, a 1 hectare area was fenced in 1988 and a grid of 49 (48 at one playa location) 1m x 1m replicate quadrats was laid out when sampling began in 1989. In fall, winter, and spring periods aboveground biomass was calculated for each species and quadrat at each NPP site. These calculations rely on two data sources: 1) non-destructive horizontal cover and vertical height measurements of individual plants, or plant parts, within each quadrat, and 2) linear regression coefficients for each plant species derived from off-quadrat cover, height, and harvested biomass measurements. NPP is then calculated as the positive biomass increment between seasons. The annual totals in this dataset are derived by summing mean site NPP values for winter (October - February), spring (February - May), and fall (May - October) increments for a single calendar year. Data collection is ongoing with new annual NPP values calculated after the conclusion of each growing season.Attention:1) Calculated values in this data package have changed over time as the methodology for estimating biomass has changed. 2) Relating long-term NPP in this package with long-term precipitation is problematic given the importance of wet and dry periods and their effect on production in these ecosystems.See Notes 1 & 2 in the methods element for further details.</p>

In this dataset a total of 22,648 adult occurrence records comprising 9,657 unique events are documented for 92 species of <em>Anthidium</em>, including the invasive range of two introduced species from Eurasia, <em>A. oblongatum</em> (Illiger) and <em>A. manicatum</em> (Linnaeus). The geospatial coverage of the dataset extends from northern Canada and Alaska to southern Argentina, and from below sea level in Death Valley, California, USA, to 4,700 m a.s.l. in Tucumán, Argentina. The majority of the records in the dataset correspond to information recorded from individual specimens examined by the authors during this project, and deposited into 60 biodiversity collections located in Africa, Europe, North and South America.<br />
A fraction (4.8%) of the occurrence records were taken from the literature, largely California records from a taxonomic treatment with some additional records for the two introduced species. The temporal scale of the dataset represents collection events recorded between 1886 and 2012.</p>

Aphidnet,"<p>AphID includes a key to the 66 most polyphagous and cosmopolitan aphid species. The key for slide-mounted specimens has 132 end points. The key does not include males, oviparae, or immatures. It may not work for all fundatrices or alatae and apterae from primary hosts (for those species with host alternation). AphID includes all 38 aphid species in the dichotomous keys to polyphagous aphids in the three seminal works by Roger Blackman & Victor Eastop (1994, 2000, 2006). The remaining aphids represent the 28 species most frequently intercepted at United States ports of entry that are not already represented on the Blackman & Eastop list. AphID offers users detailed descriptions of morphological features critical to identifying aphids along with annotated photographs to help illustrate each feature. Separate pages are devoted to suites of features, for example all features of the antenna are found on the same page. The morphology pages are crosslinked with a detailed glossary.</p>

"Asian giant hornet, Vespa mandarinia, genome assembly","<p>The Asian giant hornet, <em>Vespa mandarinia</em>, has a native range that extends from northern India to East Asia. In 2019, the hornet was confirmed for the first time in North America, posing an invasive threat to honey bees and human health. In September 2019, local beekeepers, tracked down a nest in a park in Nanaimo on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada and exterminated it. The specimen we used for genome sequencing was obtained from that nest, the first one found in North America. DNA was extracted from the thorax for PacBio HiFi sequencing on two cells and data were assembled using IPA to yield a contig assembly of 248 Mb with a 3.14 Mb N50. The assembly was generated by the Agricultural Research Service's Ag100Pest Initiative in collaboration with Pacific Biosciences. This high-quality genome assembly is being released prior to publication in scientific journals as a public service to the research community.</p>

"Assessing the rate and reversibility of large herbivore effects on community composition in a semi-arid grassland ecosystem with GZTX data on the Central Plains Experimental Range, Nunn, Colorado, USA 1992-2017","<p>This data package was produced initially by researchers working on the Shortgrass Steppe Long Term Ecological Research (SGS-LTER) Project, administered at Colorado State University. Then, was continued by the Rangeland Resources and Systems Research Unit of the USDA Agricultural Research Service. Data collection was conducted on the Central Plains Experimental Range in Nunn, Colorado.</p>
<p>When the CPER was established in 1939, researchers constructed a .5-1 ha grazing exclosure in each of the pastures. These areas have remained protected from grazing for the past 70 years. The remaining areas have been grazed for the past 20+ years. This collection of pastures and exclosures provided an extraordinary opportunity to reinitiate grazing and protection, and evaluate the balance between degradation and aggradation. We proposed to rearrange fences and expose areas to grazing that have been protected for 50 years, and protect areas from grazing that had been grazed for 50 years. The combinations of grazing conditions were: 1. Long-term protection 2. Long-term grazing (moderate) 3. 50 years of protection followed by grazing 4. 50 years of grazing followed by protection Net primary production, nitrogen dynamics, cattle utilization, and community dynamics of vegetation were measured.

BBGD454: an Online Database for Blueberry Genomic Data Transcriptome analysis of Blueberry using 454 EST sequencing,"<p>NOTE: This dataset is no longer publicly available.</p>
<p>This database houses over 500,000 sequences that were generated and assembled into approximately 15,000 contigs, annotated and functionally mapped to Gene Ontology (GO) terms.</p>
<p>Blueberry (<em>Vaccinium corymbosum</em>) is a major berry crop in the United States. Next generation sequencing methodologies, such as 454, have been demonstrated to be successful and efficient in producing a snap-shot of transcriptional activities during an organism’s developmental stage(s) or its response to biotic or abiotic stresses. Such application of this new sequencing technique allows for high-throughput, genome-wide experimental verification of known and novel transcripts. We have applied a high-throughput pyrosequencing technology (454 EST sequencing) for transcriptome profiling of blueberry during different stages of fruit development to gain an understanding of the genes that are up or down regulated during this process. We have also sequenced flower buds at four different stages of cold acclimation to gain a better understanding of the genes and biochemical pathways that are up- or down-regulated during cold acclimation, since extreme low temperatures are known to reduce crop yield and cause major losses to US farmers. We have also sequenced a leaf sample to compare its transcriptome profile with that of bud and fruit samples. Over 500,000 sequences were generated and assembled into approximately 15,000 contigs and were annotated and functionally mapped to Gene Ontology (GO) terms. A database was developed to house these sequences and their annotations. A web based interface was also developed to allow collaborators to search\browse the data and aid in the analysis and interpretation of the data. The availability of these sequences will allow for future advances, such as the development of a blueberry microarray to study gene expression, and will aid in the blueberry genome sequencing effort that is underway.<br />

BBGD: an Online Database for Blueberry Genomic Data,"<p>NOTE: This dataset is no longer publicly available.</p>
<p>BBGD (<a href=""http://bioinformatics.towson.edu/BBGD/"">http://bioinformatics.towson.edu/BBGD/</a>) was developed as a database for blueberry genomics. BBGD is both a sequence and gene expression database. It stores both EST and microarray data and allows scientists to correlate expression profiles with gene function. BBGD is a public online database. ""Presently, the main focus of the database is the identification of genes in blueberry that are significantly induced or suppressed after low temperature exposure. ""</p>
<p>To gain a better understanding of changes in gene expression associated with cold acclimation in blueberry, the Rowland laboratory (USDA-ARS, Beltsville, MD)  has undertaken a genomics approach based on the analysis of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs). Initially, two standard cDNA libraries were constructed using RNA from cold-acclimated and non-acclimated floral buds of the blueberry cultivar ‘Bluecrop’ (<em>Vaccinium corymbosum</em> L.) and about 1200 5’-end ESTs were generated from each of the libraries. About 100 3’-end ESTs were generated from the cold-acclimated library as well.</p>
<p>The Blueberry EST database contains EST sequences from a number blueberry libraries including cold acclimated and non-acclimated libraries. It also includes forward and reverse subtractive libraries.</p>
<p>You can query the sequence database by clone ID, accession number or gene (clone) name below. Or you can get a list (in tabular) format of all the clones in a particular library by clicking on the library name on the left side navigation bar.</p>

BESTPRED: Best Prediction Programs,"<p>A set of programs for best prediction of lactation yields.</p>
<p>Lactation records of any reasonable length now can be processed with the selection index method known as best prediction (BP). Previous prediction programs were limited to the 305-d standard used since 1935. Best prediction was implemented in 1998 to calculate lactation records in USDA genetic evaluations, replacing the test interval method used since 1969 to calculate lactation records. Best prediction is more complex but also more accurate, particularly when testing is less frequent. Programs were reorganized to output better graphics, give users simpler access to options, and provide additional output, such as BP of daily yields. Test-day data for 6 breeds were extracted from the national dairy database, and lactation lengths were required to be ≥500 d (Ayrshire, Milking Shorthorn) or ≥800 d (all others). Average yield and SD at any day in milk (DIM) were estimated by fitting 3-parameter Wood’s curves (milk, fat, protein) and 4-parameter exponential functions (somatic cell score) to means and SD of 15- (≤300 DIM) and 30-d (&gt;300 DIM) intervals. Correlations among TD yields were estimated using an autoregressive matrix to account for biological changes and an identity matrix to model daily measurement error. Autoregressive parameters (r) were estimated separately for first (r = 0.998) and later parities (r = 0.995). These r values were slightly larger than previous estimates due to the inclusion of the identity matrix. Correlations between traits were modified so that correlations between somatic cell score and other traits may be nonzero. The new lactation curves and correlation functions were validated by extracting TD data from the national database, estimating 305-d yields using the original and new programs, and correlating those results. Daily BP of yield were validated using daily milk weights from on-farm meters in university research herds. Correlations ranged from 0.900 to 0.988 for 305-d milk yield. High correlations ranged from 0.844 to 0.988 for daily yields, although correlations were as low as 0.015 on d 1 of lactation, which may be due to calving-related disorders that are not accounted for by BP. Correlations between 305-d yield calculated using 50-d intervals from 50 to 250 DIM and 305-yield calculated using all TD to 500 DIM increased as TD data accumulated. Many cows can profitably produce for &gt;305 DIM, and the revised program provides a flexible tool to model these records.</p>

Baseline survey for beef cattle producers in the Southwest and Southern Plains,"<p>This data package includes survey questions from beef cattle producers collectively operating in at least 31 counties in at least 7 states (California, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas) - 'at least' because there were some respondents who chose not to provide the location of their operation. Responses were collected between January 22, 2020 and May 31, 2021. Most of the surveys were administered in person at the 2020 Southwest Beef Symposium in Amarillo, TX. The survey was also placed online and an additional few responses were collected through the online survey. These data represent a sample of convenience as no formal sampling scheme was employed in soliciting responses. Survey responses are summarized in the publication, Snapshot of Rancher Perspectives on Creative Cattle Management Options (Elias et. al, 2020).The purpose of gathering these data was to learn more about the characteristics of beef cattle producers in the region and to gauge producer interest in precision livestock ranching technologies and heritage cattle – both strategies being researched by the Sustainable Southwest Beef Project to support sustainability of ranching operations in the Southwest and Southern Plains regions of the US.</p>

"Bioenergy Cropping Systems Study for Resilient Economic Agricultural Practices in Mandan, North Dakota","<p>Bioenergy Cropping Systems Study for Resilient Economic Agricultural Practices in Mandan, North Dakota</p>
<p>Rigorous economic analyses are crucial for the successful launch of lignocellulosic bioenergy facilities in 2014 and beyond. Our objectives are to (1) introduce readers to a query tool developed to use data downloaded from the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) REAPnet for constructing enterprise budgets and (2) demonstrate the use of the query tool with REAPnet data from two field research sites (Ames, IA, and Mandan, ND) for evaluating short-term economic performance of various biofuel feedstock production strategies. Our results for both sites showed that short-term (&lt;3 years) impacts on grain profitability were lower at lower average annual crop residue removal rates. However, it will be important to monitor longer term changes to see if grain profitability declines over time and if biomass harvest degrades soil resources. Analyses for Iowa showed short-term breakeven field-edge biomass prices of $26–$42 Mg−1 among the most efficient strategies, while results for North Dakota showed breakeven prices of $54–$73 Mg−1. We suggest that development of the data query tool is important because it helps illustrate several different soil and crop management strategies that could be used to provide sustainable feedstock supplies.</p>

The Biofuel Residue Removal experiment was established at Swan Lake Research farm near Morris MN in 2005. It consists of 3 separate experimental sites, one for each of three tillages—Chisel Plow, No Tillage established in 1995 and No Tillage established in 2005. Four residue removal treatments with 4 replicates were established in a corn/soybean rotation where each phase of the rotation was present each year. Each replicate has 8 plots, 4 removal treatments times 2 crops. Residue removal treatments are no removal, half removal, complete removal, and 75 % removal which was changed to cob removal in 2008.  The 3 experiments have a total of 96 plots—3 tillages x 4 removal rates x 2 crops x 4 replicates.  Greenhouse gas fluxes were measured from spring of 2008 through planting in 2011 in the no and complete removal plots. Root and above ground samples were taken at 75% silk (corn) or R6 (soybean) for plots where greenhouse gasses were measured. Soil samples to 1 meter were taken in 2005 and 2010. Veronica Acosta-Martinez from Lubbock TX measured enzymes and FAME from samples taken in 2008. POM was measured in 2005 and 2009. Erosivity was measured using a rotary sieve in 2011, 2012, and 2013. Corn biomass was sampled at physiological maturity and divided into above ear shank, below ear shank, and cob. It was analyzed for C and N and microwave digested for ICP analysis.</p>

A mounting racket and spirit level (part #’s MSRMB and MSRSLA respectively, available from Cropscan inc. <a href=""http://www.cropscan.com/mpscs.html"">http://www.cropscan.com/mpscs.html</a>) were attached to the pole in a manner so that when the camera is mounted, and the bubble in the spirit level is centered, then the focal plane of the camera is perpendicular to the ground resulting in a nadir image of the ground beneath the camera.  The fully extended pole camera assembly was carried diagonally across each plot in field 70/71 an East to West or West to East transect with photos being taken every 9 paces.  The unit was angled in such a way that the shadow from the pole and camera was not included in the photo.

It uses the ASCE Standardized Reference Evapotranspiration (ET) Equation for calculating grass and alfalfa reference ET at hourly and daily time steps. This program uses the more complex equation for estimating clear-sky solar radiation provided in Appendix D of the ASCE-EWRI ET Manual. Users have the option of using single set or time series weather data to calculate reference ET. Daily reference ET can be calculated either by summing the hourly ET values for a given day or by using averages of the climatic data.</p>

ET data are used for a variety of water management and research purposes such as irrigation scheduling, water and crop modeling, streamflow, water availability, and many more. Remote sensing products have been widely used to create spatially representative ET data sets which provide important information from field to regional scales. As UAV capabilities increase, remote sensing use is likely to also increase. For that purpose, scientists at the USDA-ARS research laboratory in Bushland, TX developed the Bushland Evapotranspiration and Agricultural Remote Sensing System (BEARS) software. The BEARS software is a Java based software that allows users to process remote sensing data to generate ET outputs using predefined models, or enter custom equations and models. The capability to define new equations and build new models expands the applicability of the BEARS software beyond ET mapping to any remote sensing application. The software also includes an image viewing tool that allows users to visualize outputs, as well as draw an area of interest using various shapes.</p>

CCE Nitrogen Index Tool,"<p>The effectiveness of nitrogen fertilizer in maximizing agricultural production and increasing economic returns for farmers has led to its widespread use. However, when this element is applied to a farming system, it can enter the surrounding environment via atmospheric, surface and leaching pathways. Consultants, extension agents, farmers, and other stakeholders need tools than can be used to quickly calculate the risk of nitrogen movement into the environment. The Nitrogen Index can assist users in making these assessments by integrating data on a series of management practices, weather conditions, soil characteristics and off-site factors. This tool has been tested using data from different agroecosystems across the United States, China, Mexico, Argentina, a Mediterranean region in Spain, and the Caribbean. It has performed well in comparing the effects of different management practices on nitrogen losses by distinguishing practices with high and very high risk levels from practices with medium, low and very low risk levels.</p>

CDRRC growing season aridity and grazing season vegetation biomass data,"<p>Growing season aridity and livestock grazing seasonality can influence biomass production of perennial grasses in dryland systems. For this study, we used a long-term dataset (1967-2004) to investigate the independent and joint effects of growing season aridity (De Martonne aridity index calculated for the months of June through September) and grazing season (yearlong continuous, fall, winter/spring, or summer season grazing) on the mean annual biomass (kg per hectare) of the perennial grasses Bouteloua eriopoda (black grama), Aristida spp. (threeawn), and Sporobolus spp. (dropseed) in a southwestern United States Chihuahuan Desert rangeland system. Biomass data were collected from 78 permanent sampling transects that were within one mile (1609.34 m) distance to water. Over the 37-year study period, total perennial grass biomass decreased as growing season aridity increased, but the extent of this relationship depended upon season of grazing and specific grass taxon. Aridity-related decreases in total perennial grass biomass were most severe in the summer and fall summer seasonal grazing pastures, primarily due to inherently low black grama levels. Our findings indicate that over time, summer and fall grazing can potentially exacerbate the negative effects of increasing aridity on perennial grass biomass.</p>

CPM - Cotton Production Model,"<p>A new process-based cotton model, CPM, has been developed to simulate the growth and development of upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) throughout the growing season with minimal data input. CPM predicts final cotton yield for any combination of soil, weather, cultivar and sequence of management actions.</p>
<p>Over the last 30 years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has conducted a wide range of research on cotton, including work to develop a series of ""production models"" designed to serve as decision aids to cotton producers. In 1996, ARS decided to develop a new ""second generation"" Cotton Production Model (CPM) that would retain the best features of the earlier versions in a new, more versatile, and more user friendly framework. The development process was completed to the stage of beta-testing, when the need to redirect limited resources to other priorities caused ARS to decide not to complete the validation process.</p>
<p>ARS believes that CPM, while only partially validated, has the potential to make useful contributions to American cotton producers when completed. For these reasons, ARS decided to make the model available for further development and commercialization.</p>
<p>The Cotton Production Model (CPM) was developed with a modular structure using an object-oriented programming language, C++. The model draws upon the latest scientific knowledge available, and is intended to be used with a wide variety of cotton types across the entire US Cotton Belt.  CPM is written in C++ using a new modular structure that allows flexibility and adaptability.  This object-oriented structure should allow modules to be incorporated into process-based models of other crop species (see Acock, B. and V. R. Reddy. 1977.  Designing an object-oriented structure for crop models. Ecological Modeling 94: 33-44).  In addition to being modular and generic, CPM has other advantages over earlier models.  Compared to previous cotton models, CPM is more robust, more user-friendly, more easily maintained, and more easily updated with future advances in science.  The algorithms that simulate crop growth are derived in part from the best of each of the previous models, and they incorporate new physiological information as well.  A new feature of CPM is that it incorporates 2DSOIL, an excellent up-to-date soil and root process model (see Timlin, D. J., Y. Pachepsky, and B. Acock. 1996. A design for a modular, generic soil simulator to interface with plant models. Agronomy Journal 88:162-169 ).  2DSOIL tracks water movement through the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum with hourly time-steps. It also incorporates a new model of plant water relations that responds realistically to water stress.  CPM has updated treatments of carbon and nitrogen stresses compared to previous models, and it is designed for easy addition of responses to phosphorus and potassium. Because the growth of each leaf, inter-node and fruit is simulated separately, CPM should be easily linked to pest or disease models.</p>
<p>CPM has the potential to be useful as a decision aid for cotton farmers and crop production consultants.  If fully developed, it would be a valuable tool to optimize management inputs such as irrigation, fertilization, plant growth regulators, and defoliant application prior to harvest.  In its current version, however, CPM has not yet been fully validated to be useful as a decision aid.  The released version of CPM should be considered an advanced model suitable for research purposes.  ARS does not endorse its use for any other purpose at this time. Of particular importance to a decision aid model is the user interface.  The interface under which CPM has been developed and tested is one that was earlier developed for the soybean model, GLYCIM, and has been documented elsewhere (Acock, B., Pachepsky, Y. A., Mironenko, E. V., Whisler, F. D., and Reddy, V. R. 1999. GUICS: A Generic User Interface for On-Farm Crop Simulations. Agronomy Journal. 91:657-665).  CPM is part of the current release of GUICS.</p>

CXTFIT,"<p>Successful predictions of the fate and transport of solutes in the subsurface hinges on the availability of accurate transport parameters. We modified and updated the CXTFIT (version 1.0) code of Parker and van Genuchten [1984] for estimating solute transport parameters using a nonlinear least-squares parameter optimization method. The program may be used to solve the inverse problem by fitting mathematical solutions of theoretical transport models, based upon the convection-dispersion equation (CDE), to experimental results. This approach allows parameters in the transport models to be quantified. The program may also be used to solve the direct or forward problem to determine the concentration as a function of time and/or position. Three different one-dimensional transport models are included: the conventional CDE; the chemical and physical nonequilibrium CDE; and  a stochastic stream tube model based upon the local-scale CDE with equilibrium or nonequilibrium adsorption. The two independent stochastic parameters in the stream-tube model are the pore-water velocity, v, and either the dispersion coefficient, D, the distribution coefficient, Kd, or the nonequilibrium rate parameter, alpha. These pairs of stochastic parameters were described with a bivariate lognormal probability density function (pdf). Examples are given on how transport parameters may be determined from laboratory or field tracer experiments for several types of initial and boundary conditions, as well as different zero-order production profiles.</p>
<p>The program comes with a user manual giving a detailed description of the computer program, including the subroutines used to evaluate the analytical solutions for optimizing model parameters. Input and output files for all major problems are also included in the manual.</p>

Cacao Genome Database,"<p>Not only is cacao the basic ingredient in the world’s favorite confection, chocolate, but it provides a livelihood for over 6.5 million farmers in Africa, South America and Asia and ranks as one of the top ten agriculture commodities in the world. Historically, cocoa production has been plagued by serious losses due to pests and diseases. The release of the cacao genome sequence will provide researchers with access to the latest genomic tools, enabling more efficient research and accelerating the breeding process, thereby expediting the release of superior cacao cultivars. The sequenced genotype, Matina 1-6, is representative of the genetic background most commonly found in the cacao producing countries, enabling results to be applied immediately and broadly to current commercial cultivars.  Matina 1-6 is highly homozygous which greatly reduces the complexity of the sequence assembly process. While the sequence provided is a preliminary release, it already covers 92% of the genome, with approximately 35,000 genes. We will continue to refine the assembly and annotation, working toward a complete finished sequence. Updates will be made available via the main project website.</p>

"Carbon Crops Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network and Resilient Economic Agricultural Practices in Morris, Minnesota","<p>Carbon Crops Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network and Resilient Economic Agricultural Practices in Morris, Minnesota<br />
The overall goal of the Carbon Crop study, established in 2000, was to assess strategies for increasing soil C sequestration including converting to no till systems and including perennial grasses (e.g., switchgrass and big bluestem) Overall, the goal of the study has remained constant, although individual treatments were changed after an incremental soil sampling, in response to new hypotheses and questions. Soil sampling is conducted as treatment changes are implemented. In 2012, two of the perennial grass systems (spring harvest of Switchgrass and Big Bluestem) were changed to corn/soybean rotations, beginning with a soybean entry point, to determine if the SOC accrued under the perennial system was lost by converting to a short annual rotation managed without tillage. The second change made was to compare the productivity between recent and traditional switchgrass cultivars. The final change was conversion of autumn harvest of Big Bluestem treatment replaced with an annual biomass crop – Sorghum-Sudan grass. Soil samples were taken to 1 m in 2000, 2006, 2011, and 2016. Nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide fluxes from the soil were measured from June 2009 through March 2012.</p>

LTAR scientists seek to determine ways to ensure sustainability and enhance food production (and quality) and ecosystem services at broad regional scales.  They are conducting common experiments across the LTAR network to compare traditional production strategies (“business as usual or BAU) with aspirational strategies, which include novel technologies and collaborations with farmers and ranchers. Within- and cross-site network success towards achieving the desired outcomes of enhancing quality food production and reducing environmental impact requires that LTAR scientists and collaborators have well-timed access to various data.

Cligen,"<p>Cligen is a stochastic weather generator which produces daily estimates of precipitation, temperature, dewpoint, wind, and solar radiation for a single geographic point, using monthly parameters (means, SD's, skewness, etc.) derived from the historic measurements. Unlike other climate generators, it produces individual storm parameter estimates, including time to peak, peak intensity, and storm duration, which are required to run the WEPP and the WEPS soil erosion models. Station parameter files to run Cligen for several thousand U. S. sites are available for download from this website: also data and software to build station files for international sites. With the exception of Tmin, Tmax, and Tdew temperatures (changed in January 2004), daily estimates for each parameter are generated independently of the others. With the current random number generator, subsequent runs on the same machine made with identical inputs will produce identical results.</p>
<p>Users of daily simulation models should consider the impacts of Cligen's characteristics on their application. Individual parameter distributions may be expected to reproduce monthly historic distributions quite well. However, if the model in question is sensitive to the daily interactions of two or more of the parameters Cligen produces, Cligen may not be the most appropriate weather generator to use. This is because for a given day, it generates solar radiation, and maximum and minimum temperatures completely independently from precipitation. Experience and common sense tell us that these parameters are NOT independent. In practice this may not be a huge issue, since it is not uncommon for models to be sensitive to one weather parameter on a daily basis, and relatively insensitive to the others, as long as their monthly trends are preserved.</p>

Comparison of methods to detect low levels of Salmonella enterica in surface waters to support antimicrobial resistance surveillance efforts performed in multiple laboratories,"<p>Identifying and developing effective and sensitive detection methods for antimicrobial resistant Salmonella enterica from surface water is a goal of the U.S. National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS). No specific microbiological methods used in surveillance efforts for Salmonella enterica or antimicrobial resistant S. enterica in water have been standardized or reported in the U.S. Here we describe a multi-laboratory evaluation of four methods, bulk water enrichment (BW), vertical Modified Moore Swab (VMMS), modified Standard Method 9260.B3 (SM), and dead-end ultrafiltration (DEUF), to recover S. enterica from surface water. In Phase 1, one-liter volumes of surface water (n=60) were collected from the same site in Fall 2021 on five different dates. Water was shipped and analyzed at four different USDA ARS laboratories for recovery of environmental Salmonella and an inoculated fluorescent S. Typhimurium strain (ca. 30 CFU/L). One-liter samples (n=20) were subjected to recovery and enrichment by either BW, VMMS, or SM. Overall, fluorescent S. Typhimurium and environmental Salmonella spp. were recovered from 65% (39/60) and 45% (27/60) of water samples, respectively. SM, VMMS, and BW recovered fluorescent S. Typhimurium from 75%, 60% and 60% of inoculated samples, respectively. Analysis by Chi-squared test determined that laboratory location had a significant (p &lt; 0.05) effect on recovery compared to method or date of water collection. In Phase 2, DEUF was compared to SM at two different laboratory locations to recover fluorescent S. Typhimurium (30 CFU/L) from 1-L samples. SM and DEUF recovered S. Typhimurium from 100% (20/20) and 95% (19/20) of inoculated water samples, respectively; laboratory location nor recovery method (p&gt; 0.05) affected S. Typhimurium recovery. Results indicate that SM method consistently recovered low levels of Salmonella from inoculated water samples and should be prioritized for Salmonella recovery from surface water.</p>

Conservation Practice Effectiveness (CoPE) Database,"<p>The Conservation Practice Effectiveness Database compiles information on the effectiveness of a suite of conservation practices. This database presents a compilation of data on the effectiveness of innovative practices developed to treat contaminants in surface runoff and tile drainage water from agricultural landscapes. Traditional conservation practices such as no-tillage and conservation crop rotation are included in the database, as well as novel practices such as drainage water management, blind inlets, and denitrification bioreactors. This will be particularly useful to conservation planners seeking new approaches to water quality problems associated with dissolved constituents, such as nitrate or soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), and for researchers seeking to understand the circumstances in which such practices are most effective. Another novel feature of the database is the presentation of information on how individual conservation practices impact multiple water quality concerns. This information will be critical to enabling conservationists and policy makers to avoid (or at least be aware of) undesirable tradeoffs, whereby great efforts are made to improve water quality related to one resource concern (e.g., sediment) but exacerbate problems related to other concerns (e.g., nitrate or SRP). Finally, we note that the Conservation Practice Effectiveness Database can serve as a source of the soft data needed to calibrate simulation models assessing the potential water quality tradeoffs of conservation practices, including those that are still being developed. This database is updated and refined annually.</p>

Cotton Irrigation Tool,"<p>Dropping Ogallala aquifer levels and changing commodity prices and energy costs make irrigation management an important but uncertain issue to west Texas cotton producers. For example, is deficit or full irrigation more profitable under the current lint price and pumping cost conditions? Also, what is the best way to divide production into dryland and irrigated acreage with limited well capacity? To help producers answer these questions this web application estimates the effects of irrigation on the profitability of center pivot cotton production on the Southern High Plains. It's main purpose is to show the impact of irrigation on yield and the related effects on both profits per acre and profits over a center pivot area with combined dryland and irrigated production.</p>

Cover Crop Chart (version 2.0): Helping producers choose cover crops in crop and forage production systems,"<p>The Cover Crop Chart (v. 2.0) is designed to assist producers with decisions on the use of cover crops in crop and forage production systems. The chart, patterned after the periodic table of elements, includes information on 58 crop species that may be planted individually or in cocktail mixtures. Information on growth cycle, relative water use, plant architecture, seeding depth,  forage quality, pollination characteristics, and nutrient cycling are included for most crop species.</p>
<p>The Cover Crop Chart is easy to use, requiring only Adobe Acrobat software. Using the chart as a guide, users can select individual crop species by clicking on the name which will direct them to additional information about the selected crop. Icons within each crop page return the user to the chart, thereby easily allowing comparisons of different crops.</p>
<p>The Cover Crop Chart represents a compendium of information from multiple sources throughout the U.S. and Canada, and is not based on research conducted at the USDA-ARS Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory (NGPRL). Primary sources of information included the Midwest Cover Crops Council, USDA - Sustainable Agriculture Research & Education (SARE), USDA - Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) PLANTS Database, relevant peer-reviewed journal articles, and the 3rd  edition of  *Managing Cover Crops Profitably* (Andy Clark, Editor).</p>
<p>Information on specific crops is occasionally generalized and/or approximate to accommodate wide variation in geographic/agronomic conditions, and therefore may not reflect performance in on-farm conditions. Accordingly, USDA - Agricultural Research Service (ARS) makes no guarantee to the performance of specific crops based on information provided within the Cover Crop Chart.</p>
<p>The Cover Crop Chart is produced and distributed by the staff of the USDA-ARS NGPRL, Mandan, ND. Mark Liebig and Holly Johnson contributed to the design and content of the chart with input from NGPRL staff and producers and technicians from the Area IV Soil Conservation Districts of North Dakota and NRCS staff at the Bismarck and Dickinson Field/Area Offices.</p>

"Criollo and Crossbred Steer Comparison: Weight Gain, Grazing, Carcass Quality, 2015-2017","<p>Rarámuri Criollo cows have behavioral traits that are desirable for rangelands in arid environments, but calves from this biotype are difficult to market through conventional methods. One strategy to improve marketability is to crossbreed these cows with traditional beef breed bulls. However, it is unclear whether crossbred calves will achieve marketable weights and carcass qualities on rangeland and whether they will retain the desirable grazing behaviors of their mothers. We evaluated these traits for two cohorts of Rarámuri Criollo (JRC), Mexican Criollo (MC), and Criollo × beef-breed crossbred (XC) steers. Final live and carcass weights of XC were greater than JRC and MC, but all three groups were market ready at 30-mo after finishing on grass. Carcass quality and average daily gain did not differ among biotypes. Both JRC and XC steers exhibited grazing patterns similar to those previously observed in JRC cows. These results suggest JRC, MC, and XC steers can achieve desirable slaughter weights in 30 months using a rangeland-based grass-fed protocol, and JRC and XC steers retain desirable grazing behaviors of JRC cows.</p>

Version (3.1)  contains the previous version (3.0) and adds new information gathered from additional cropping sequence research, as well as supplemental information related to use of annual crops as cover crops.</p>
<p>Cropping systems need to be inherently flexible to take advantage of economic opportunities and/or adapt to environmental realities. Therefore, this program applies the principles of Dynamic Cropping Systems to help users select cropping sequences best suited to their particular situation. The research data used to develop the Crop Sequence Calculator were collected from no-till farming experiments conducted near Mandan, ND from 1998 to 2005. This version (3.1) contains the previous version (3.0) and adds new information gathered from additional cropping sequence research, as well as supplemental information related to use of annual crops as cover crops. Users are asked to select the appropriate data set for answering questions unique to their enterprise. The first data set is what we call Phase II. The Phase II experiment consisted of predominantly cool-season crops, and the weather conditions were considerably wetter than average. The ten crops used for this phase are shown in the Phase II Crops box. The Phase III experiment used some of the same crops as the Phase II, but included other crops considered to be warm-season crops. These crops are listed in the Phase III Crops box. The crops used in both phases are highlighted. Precipitation received during the Phase III experiment was below average.</p>

"Cryptogam crust data from the long-term Small Mammal Exclosure Study (SMES) at Jornada Basin LTER, 1995-2005","<p>This data package contains cryptogam cover data from plots with various levels of herbivore exclusion on Jornada Experimental Range (JER) and Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) lands. Study sites were established in 1995; one in black grama grassland and the other in creosotebush shrubland to compare the impact of herbivores on ecosystem processes between these vegetation types. Parallel studies were established at the Sevilleta LTER site (New Mexico, USA) and Mapimi Biosphere Reserve (Durango, Mexico). Each study site is 1 km by 0.5 km in area. Four replicate experimental blocks were randomly located at each study site to measure vegetation responses using exclusion treatments including a) all mammalian herbivores, including cattle, lagomorphs, and rodents, b) lagomorphs and cattle only, c) cattle only, and d) control accessible to all herbivores. Thirty-six sampling points were positioned at 5.8-meter intervals on a systematically located 6 by 6 point grid within each plot. A permanent one-meter by one-meter vegetation measurement quadrat is located at each of the 36 points. Each year in spring and fall from 1995-2005, the percent of a quadrat covered in cryptogams was estimated by summing the percent of each 10 cm square within a quadrat (including 100 10-cm squares) containing cryptogams (See methods for a detailed explanation). Cryptogams (biological soil crusts) include lichens, algae, cyanobacteria, and moss. This study is complete.</p>

Current and projected research data storage needs of Agricultural Research Service researchers in 2016,"<p>The USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) recently established <a href=""https://axon.ars.usda.gov/Science%20Links/Pages/Big-Data.aspx"">SCINet</a> , which consists of a shared high performance computing resource, Ceres, and the dedicated high-speed Internet2 network used to access Ceres. Current and potential SCINet users are using and generating very large datasets so SCINet needs to be provisioned with adequate data storage for their active computing. It is not designed to hold data beyond active research phases. At the same time, the National Agricultural Library has been developing the Ag Data Commons, a research data catalog and repository designed for public data release and professional data curation. Ag Data Commons needs to anticipate the size and nature of data it will be tasked with handling.</p>
<p>The ARS Web-enabled Databases Working Group, organized under the SCINet initiative, conducted a study to establish baseline data storage needs and practices, and to make projections that could inform future infrastructure design, purchases, and policies. The SCINet Web-enabled Databases Working Group helped develop the survey which is the basis for an internal report. While the report was for internal use, the survey and resulting data may be generally useful and are being released publicly.</p>
<p>From October 24 to November 8, 2016 we administered a 17-question survey (Appendix A) by emailing a Survey Monkey link to all ARS Research Leaders, intending to cover data storage needs of all 1,675 SY (Category 1 and Category 4) scientists. We designed the survey to accommodate either individual researcher responses or group responses. Research Leaders could decide, based on their unit's practices or their management preferences, whether to delegate response to a data management expert in their unit, to all members of their unit, or to themselves collate responses from their unit before reporting in the survey.</p>
<p>Larger storage ranges cover vastly different amounts of data so the implications here could be significant depending on whether the true amount is at the lower or higher end of the range. Therefore, we requested more detail from ""Big Data users,"" those 47 respondents who indicated they had more than 10 to 100 TB or over 100 TB total current data (Q5).  All other respondents are called ""Small Data users."" Because not all of these follow-up requests were successful, we used actual follow-up responses to estimate likely responses for those who did not respond.</p>
<p>We defined active data as data that would be used within the next six months. All other data would be considered inactive, or archival.</p>
<p>To calculate per person storage needs we used the high end of the reported range divided by 1 for an individual response, or by G, the number of individuals in a group response. For Big Data users we used the actual reported values or estimated likely values.</p>

<p>Large amounts of pesticides are applied worldwide on a wide variety of crops. While pesticides are essential for high quality, abundant food, they pose risks if applied improperly.  Of particular concern is the potential for spray droplets to drift to areas other than the intended targets.</p>
<p>In order to assist applicators choose the optimum spray conditions to minimize spray drift, Heping Zhuand Robert Foxof the USDA Agricultural Research Service and Erdal Ozkan of the Ohio State University have developed DRIFTSIM--a user-friendly computer program capable of predicting drift distances of spray droplets under a wide variety of conditions. Unlike other computer simulation software, DRIFTSIM requires no special skills to operate and computer system requirements are minimal:  Pentium processor, CD drive, MS-Windows version 3.1 or later, 8 Mb of memory, 30 Mb free hard drive space and a mouse.</p>
<p>DRIFTSIM rapidly estimates the mean drift distances of water droplets discharged from atomizers on field sprayers.</p>

Data From: Assessing variability of corn and soybean yields in central Iowa using high spatiotemporal resolution multi-satellite imagery,"<p>This dataset includes daily two-band Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI2) at 30-m resolution over a Landsat scene (path 26 and row 31) in central Iowa. Fourteen years of daily EVI2 from 2001 to 2015 (except 2012) were generated through fusing and interpolating Landsat-MODIS data.</p>
<p>Landsat surface reflectances were order and used in this study. Mostly clear Landsat images from each year were chosen to pair with MODIS images acquired from the same day to generate daily Landsat-MODIS surface reflectance using the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM). Partially clear Landsat images were also used in generating the smoothed and gap-filled daily VI time-series. All available Landsat data including Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) were used in this study.</p>
<p>The MODIS data products were downloaded and processed. These include the daily surface reflectance at both 250m (MOD09GQ) and 500m (MOD09GA) resolution, the MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) parameters at 500m resolution, and the MODIS land cover types at 500m resolution (MCD12Q1). They were used to generated daily nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) at 250m resolution for fusing with Landsat.</p>
<p>The Landsat-MODIS data fusion results for 2001-2014 were generated from a previous study (Gao et al, 2017; doi: 10.1016/j.rse.2016.11.004). Data fusion results for 2015 were generated using Landsat 8 OLI images from day 194, 226, 258 and 338 in this study. Cloud masks were extracted from Landsat and MODIS QA layers and were used to exclude cloud, cloud shadow and snow pixels. Since Landsat 5 TM operational imaging ended in November 2011 and Landsat 8 OLI has not been launched until February 2013, Landsat 7 ETM+ Scan Line Corrector (SLC)-off images are the only available Landsat data. For this reason, 2012 was not included.</p>
<p>Due to the cloud contamination in the Landsat and MODIS images, the fused Landsat-MODIS results still have invalid values or gaps. To fill these gaps, a modified Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter approach was built and applied to smooth and gap-fill EVI2. The SG filter is a moving fitting approach. Each point is smoothed using the value computed from the polynomial function fit to the observations within the moving window. The program removes spike points if the fitting errors are larger than the predefined threshold (default 3 standard deviation). The modified SG filter allows us to retain small variations but also fill large gaps in an unevenly distributed time-series EVI2.</p>
<p>Daily EVI2 files are saved in one tar file per year. Each tar file contains a binary image file and a text header file that can be displayed in the ENVI software. The binary image file has the dimension of 7201 lines by 8061 samples by 365 days and is saved in BIP (band interleaved by pixel) format. EVI2 data are saved in 4-byte float number. The text header file contains necessary information including projection and geolocation. Daily EVI2 file is named as ""flexfit_evi2.026031.yyyy.bin"", where ""026031"" refers to the Landsat path and row, and yyyy represents year and ranges from 2001-2015.</p>

Data From: Habitat type and host grazing regimen influence the soil microbial diversity and communities within potential biting midge larval habitats,"<p><em>Culicoides</em> biting midges are important vectors of diverse microbes such as viruses, protozoa, and nematodes that cause diseases in wild and domestic animals. However, little is known about the role of microbial communities in midge larval habitat utilization in the wild. In this study, we characterized microbial communities (bacterial, protistan, fungal and metazoan) in soils from disturbed (bison and cattle grazed) and undisturbed (non-grazed) pond and spring potential midge larval habitats. We evaluated the influence of habitat and grazing disturbance and their interaction on microbial communities, diversity, presence of midges, and soil properties. These data can be used to better understand environmental microbial communities in tallgrass prairie ecosystems associated with grazed versus ungrazed pond and spring habitats and to draw inferences on the interactions of these communities and soil properties with the presence of biting midge larvae. These data should not be used to make inferences for ecosystems other than tallgrass prairie, for animal management methods other than open cow-calf or bison grazing (such as feedlots, dairies, or stockyards), or for other grazing mammals (such as sheep or goats). These data were collected between the months of September and December and therefore are not representative of microbial communities present from January through August.

<p>Abstract from published manuscript:<br />
The effect of cold temperatures and exposure time on egg survival and hatching success were examined in the white-whiskered grasshopper, Ageneotettix deorum. Temperature treatments ranged from 4°C to -35°C, with treatment times ranging from 48 to 240 hours. Both decreasing temperatures and exposure time negatively affected egg survival, with a temperature below -25°C being lethal. Similar lethal temperatures are known for several North American grasshopper species. The relatively shallow location of A. deorum egg pods would result in increased vulnerability of eggs to cold temperatures in the absence of snow.</p>

Data From: Red flour beetle (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) response to volatile cues varies with strain and behavioral assay,"<p>Behavioral data for eight strains of red flour beetles in three behavioral assays and two commercial lures.</p>
<p>The red flour beetle, <em>Tribolium castaneum</em> (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), is a major pest of facilities where grain is processed because of its ability to find and colonize food resource patches. Traps baited with pheromone and kairomone lures are commonly used to monitor for the presence of insects in warehouses or flour mills, for example. However, two nonmutually exclusive components, environment and genetics, could influence insect responsiveness to volatiles, impacting the efficacy of monitoring. Intraspecific variation in attraction behavior to food and mates is largely unexplored in stored-product insects, but tapping into natural genetic variation could provide a baseline for identifying genetic mechanisms associated with finding resources. Here, we assess eight strains of <em>T. castaneum</em> for variation in response to kairomone- and pheromone-based lures using three behavioral assays: paired choice with no forced air flow, upwind attraction with forced air flow, and movement pattern in an arena with a single odor source. We find strain-specific responses to kairomones and pheromones and evidence for heritability in behavioral responses. However, environmental coefficients for behavioral responses to both lures are high, suggesting that environment, and its potential interaction with genotype, strongly influences behavioral outcomes in these assays. Furthermore, despite the different environmental conditions among the different behavioral assays, we find a correlation for volatile preference among the assays. Our results provide a baseline assessment of natural variation for preference to kairomone and pheromone lures and suggest that careful consideration of behavioral assay is key to understanding the mechanisms of attraction in these stored-product pests.</p>

<h3>Manuscript abstract</h3>
<p><em>Salmonella enterica</em> is a major cause of human foodborne illness and is often attributed to poultry food sources. <em>S. enterica</em> serovar Infantis, specifically those carrying the pESI plasmid, has become a frequently isolated serotype from poultry meat samples at processing and has caused numerous recent human infections. In 2016, the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service changed the official sampling method for raw poultry products from BPW to using neutralizing BPW (nBPW) as the rinsing agent in order to prevent residual antimicrobial effects from acidifying and oxidizing processing aids. This change was contemporaneous to the emergence of pESI-positive ser. Infantis as a prevalent serovar in poultry, prompting some to question if nBPW could be selecting for this prevalent serovar. We performed two experiments: a comparison of ser. Infantis growth in BPW versus nBPW, and a simulation of regulatory sampling methods. We found that when inoculated into both broths, ser. Infantis initially grows slightly slower in nBPW than in BPW but little difference was seen in abundance after six hours of growth. Additionally, use of nBPW to simulate poultry rinse sample and overnight cold shipping to a regulatory lab did not affect survival or subsequent growth of ser. Infantis in BPW. We concluded that the change in USDA-FSIS methodology to include nBPW in sampling procedures has likely not affected the emergence of <em>S.</em> ser. Infantis as a prevalent serovar in chicken and turkey meat product samples.</p>

<h3>Brief description of study aims</h3>
<p>Denitrification is a chemical process that releases nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. The NOR1 gene is part of the denitrification pathway in <em>Fusarium</em>. Three experiments were conducted for this study. (1) The N2O comparative experiment compares denitrification rates, as measured by N2O production, of a variety of <em>Fusarium</em> spp. strains with and without the NOR1 gene. (2) The N2O substrate experiment compares denitrification rates of selected strains on different growth media (substrates). For parts 1 and 2, linear models are fit comparing N2O production between strains and/or substrates. (3) The Bioscreen growth assay tests whether there is a pleiotropic effect of the NOR1 gene. In this portion of the analysis, growth curves are fit to assess differences in growth rate and carrying capacity between selected strains with and without the NOR1 gene.</p>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>All code is included in a .zip archive generated from a private git repository on 2022-10-13 and archived as part of this dataset.</p>
<p>The code is contained in R scripts and RMarkdown notebooks. There are two components to the analysis: the denitrification analysis (comprising parts 1 and 2 described above) and the Bioscreen growth analysis (part 3). The scripts for each are listed and described below.</p>
<h4>Analysis of results of denitrification experiments (parts 1 and 2)</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>NOR1_denitrification_analysis.Rmd</code>: The R code to analyze the experimental data comparing nitrous oxide emissions is all contained in a single RMarkdown notebook. This script analyzes the results from the comparative study and the substrate study.</li>
<li><code>n2o_subgroup_figures.R</code>: R script to create additional figures using the output from the RMarkdown notebook</li>
</ul>
<h4>Analysis of results of Bioscreen growth assay (part 3)</h4>
<ul>
<li><code>bioscreen_analysis.Rmd</code>: This RMarkdown notebook contains all R code needed to analyze the results of the Bioscreen assay comparing growth of the different strains. It could be run as is. However, the model-fitting portion was run on a high-performance computing cluster with the following scripts:
<ul>
<li><code>bioscreen_fit_simpler.R</code>: R script containing only the model-fitting portion of the Bioscreen analysis, fit using the Stan modeling language interfaced with R through the <strong>brms</strong> and <strong>cmdstanr</strong> packages.</li>
<li><code>job_bssimple.sh</code>: Job submission shell script used to submit the model-fitting R job to be run on USDA SciNet high-performance computing cluster.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional scripts developed as part of the analysis but that are not required to reproduce the analyses in the manuscript are in the <code>deprecated/</code> folder.</p>
<p>Also note the files <code>nor1-denitrification.Rproj</code> (RStudio project file) and <code>gtstyle.css</code> (stylesheet for formatting the tables in the notebooks) are included.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Data required to run the analysis scripts are archived in this dataset, other than <code>strain_lookup.csv</code>, a lookup table of strain abbreviations and full names included in the code repository for convenience. They should be placed in a folder or symbolic link called <code>project</code> within the unzipped code repository directory.</p>

Data and code from: Topographic wetness index as a proxy for soil moisture in a hillslope catena: flow algorithms and map generalization,"<p>This dataset contains all data and code necessary to reproduce the analysis presented in the manuscript:</p>
<p>Winzeler, H.E., Owens, P.R., Read Q.D.., Libohova, Z., Ashworth, A., Sauer, T. 2022. 2022. Topographic wetness index as a proxy for soil moisture in a hillslope catena: flow algorithms and map generalization. <em>Land</em> 11:2018. DOI: 10.3390/land11112018.</p>
<p>There are several steps to this analysis. The relevant scripts for each are listed below. The first step is to use the raw digital elevation data (DEM) to produce different versions of the topographic wetness index (TWI) for the study region (<strong>Calculating TWI</strong>). Then, these TWI output files are processed, along with soil moisture (volumetric water content or VWC) time series data from a number of sensors located within the study region, to create analysis-ready data objects (<strong>Processing TWI and VWC</strong>). Next, models are fit relating TWI to soil moisture (<strong>Model fitting</strong>) and results are plotted (<strong>Visualizing main results</strong>). A number of additional analyses were also done (<strong>Additional analyses</strong>).</p>
<p>Input data</p>
<p>The DEM of the study region is archived in this dataset as <code>SourceDem.zip</code>. This contains the DEM of the study region (<code>DEM1.sgrd</code>) and associated auxiliary files all called <code>DEM1.*</code> with different extensions. In addition, the DEM is provided as a .tif file called <code>USGS_one_meter_x39y400_AR_R6_WashingtonCO_2015.tif</code>.</p>
<p>The remaining data and code files are archived in the repository created with a GitHub release on 2022-10-11, <code>twi-moisture-0.1.zip</code>. The data are found in a subfolder called <code>data</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>2017_LoggerData_HEW.csv</code> through <code>2021_HEW.csv</code>: Soil moisture (VWC) logger data for each year 2017-2021 (5 files total).</li>
<li><code>2882174.csv</code>: weather data from a nearby station.</li>
<li><code>DryPeriods2017-2021.csv</code>: starting and ending days for dry periods 2017-2021.</li>
<li><code>LoggerLocations.csv</code>: Geographic locations and metadata for each VWC logger.</li>
<li><code>Logger_Locations_TWI_2017-2021.xlsx</code>: 546 topographic wetness indexes calculated at each VWC logger location. <em>note</em>: This is intermediate input created in the first step of the pipeline.</li>
</ul>
<p>Code pipeline</p>
<p>To reproduce the analysis in the manuscript run these scripts in the following order. The scripts are all found in the root directory of the repository. See the manuscript for more details on the methods.</p>
<h3>Calculating TWI</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>TerrainAnalysis.R</code>: Taking the DEM file as input, calculates 546 different topgraphic wetness indexes using a variety of different algorithms. Each algorithm is run multiple times with different input parameters, as described in more detail in the manuscript. After performing this step, it is necessary to use the SAGA-GIS GUI to extract the TWI values for each of the sensor locations. The output generated in this way is included in this repository as <code>Logger_Locations_TWI_2017-2021.xlsx</code>. Therefore it is not necessary to rerun this step of the analysis but the code is provided for completeness.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Processing TWI and VWC</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>read_process_data.R</code>: Takes raw TWI and moisture data files and processes them into analysis-ready format, saving the results as CSV.</li>
<li><code>qc_avg_moisture.R</code>: Does additional quality control on the moisture data and averages it across different time periods.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Model fitting</h3>
<p>Models were fit regressing soil moisture (average VWC for a certain time period) against a TWI index, with and without <strong>soil depth as a covariate</strong>. In each case, for both the model without depth and the model with depth, prediction performance was calculated with and without <strong>spatially-blocked cross-validation</strong>. Where cross validation wasn't used, we simply used the predictions from the model fit to all the data.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fit_combos.R</code>: Models were fit to each combination of soil moisture averaged over 57 months (all months from April 2017-December 2021) and 546 TWI indexes. In addition models were fit to soil moisture averaged over years, and to the grand mean across the full study period.</li>
<li><code>fit_dryperiods.R</code>: Models were fit to soil moisture averaged over previously identified dry periods within the study period (each 1 or 2 weeks in length), again for each of the 546 indexes.</li>
<li><code>fit_summer.R</code>: Models were fit to the soil moisture average for the months of June-September for each of the five years, again for each of the 546 indexes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Visualizing main results</h3>
<p>Preliminary visualization of results was done in a series of RMarkdown notebooks. All the notebooks follow the same general format, plotting model performance (observed-predicted correlation) across different combinations of time period and characteristics of the TWI indexes being compared. The indexes are grouped by SWI versus TWI, DEM filter used, flow algorithm, and any other parameters that varied.</p>
<p>The notebooks show the model performance metrics with and without the soil depth covariate, and with and without spatially-blocked cross-validation. Crossing those two factors, there are four values for model performance for each combination of time period and TWI index presented.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>performance_plots_bymonth.Rmd</code>: Using the results from the models fit to each month of data separately, prediction performance was averaged by month across the five years of data to show within-year trends.</li>
<li><code>performance_plots_byyear.Rmd</code>: Using the results from the models fit to each month of data separately, prediction performance was averaged by year to show trends across multiple years.</li>
<li><code>performance_plots_dry_periods.Rmd</code>: Prediction performance was presented for the models fit to the previously identified dry periods.</li>
<li><code>performance_plots_summer.Rmd</code>: Prediction performance was presented for the models fit to the June-September moisture averages.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional analyses</h3>
<p>Some additional analyses were done that may not be published in the final manuscript but which are included here for completeness.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>2019dryperiod.Rmd</code>: analysis, done separately for each day, of a specific dry period in 2019.</li>
<li><code>alldryperiodsbyday.Rmd</code>: analysis, done separately for each day, of the same dry periods discussed above.</li>
<li><code>best_indices.R</code>: after fitting models, this script was used to quickly identify some of the best-performing indexes for closer scrutiny.</li>
<li><code>wateryearfigs.R</code>: exploratory figures showing median and quantile interval of VWC for sensors in low and high TWI locations for each water year.</li>

"Data from USDA ARS Central Plains Experimental Range (CPER) near Nunn, CO: Cattle weight gains managed with light, moderate and heavy grazing intensities","<p>The USDA-Agricultural Research Service Central Plains Experimental Range (CPER) is a Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network site located ~20 km northeast of Nunn, in north-central Colorado, USA.  In 1939, scientists established the Long-term Grazing Intensity study (LTGI) with four replications of light, moderate, and heavy grazing.  Each replication had three 129.5 ha pastures with the grazing intensity treatment randomly assigned.  Today, one replication remains.  Light grazing occurs in pasture 23W (9.3 Animal Unit Days (AUD)/ha, targeted for 20% utilization of peak growing-season biomass), moderate grazing in pasture 15E (12.5 AUD/ha, 40% utilization), and heavy grazing in pasture 23E (18.6 AUD/ha, 60% utilization). British- and continental-breed yearling cattle graze the pastures season-long from mid-May to October except when forage limitations shorten the grazing season.  Individual raw data on cattle entry and exit weights, as well as weights every 28-days during the grazing season are available from 2000 to 2019.  Cattle entry and exit weights are included in this dataset.  Weight outliers (± 2 SD) are flagged for calculating summary statistics or performing statistical analysis.</p>

"Data from USDA ARS High Plains Grasslands Research Station (East Unit) near Cheyenne, WY: Yearling cattle weight gains managed in light, moderate and heavily stocked pastures (1982-2022)","<p>The USDA-Agricultural Research Service High Plains Grasslands Research Station (HPGRS) is located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, USA.  In 1982, a long-term stocking rate study on northern mixed-grass prairie was initiated with season-long (early June to October) grazing. Stocking rates defined as light (35% below NRCS recommended rate, 15 yearlings per 80 ha), moderate (NRCS recommended rate, 4 yearlings per 12ha), and heavy (33% above NRCS recommended rate, 4 yearlings per 9 ha). British- and continental-breed yearling cattle were used throughout the study years. When forage supply was limited due to drought, grazing seasons were shortened or cattle were not grazed for that season. Individual raw data on cattle entry and exit weights are available from 1982 to 2022. No grazing occurred in the years 1989, 2000, and 2002 due to drought conditions. Weight gain outliers (± 2 sd of treatment mean) were removed from the dataset.</p>

<p>In order to produce the best possible <em>de novo</em>, chromosome-scale genome assembly from error prone Pacific BioSciences continuous long reads (CLR) reads, we developed a publicly available, flexible and reproducible workflow that is containerized so it can be run on any conventional HPC, called polishCLR. This dataset provides example input primary contig assemblies to test and reproduce the demonstrated utility of our workflow.</p>
<p>The polishCLR workflow can be easily initiated from three input cases:<br />
    Case 1: An unresolved primary assembly with associated contigs, the output of FALCON 2-asm: p_ctg.fasta and a_ctg.fasta<br />
    Case 2: A haplotype-resolved but unpolished set, the output of FALCON-Unzip 3-unzip: all_p_ctg.fasta and all_h_ctg.fasta<br />
    Case 3: A haplotype-resolved, CLR long-read, Arrow-polished set of primary and alternate contigs, the output of FALCON-Unzip 4-polish: cns_p_ctg.fasta and cns_h_ctg.fasta.</p>
<p>These example data are the input contigs assemblies for the pest <em>Helicoverpa zea</em>. These contigs are built from 49.89 Gb of raw Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) CLR data generated from a single <em>H. zea</em> HzStark_Cry1AcR strain male.</p>
<p>Adult <em>H. zea</em> were collected near the USDA-ARS Genetics and Sustainability Agricultural Research Unit, Starkville, MS, USA in 2011, and transported to and maintained in a colony at the USDA Southern Insect Management Unit (SIMRU), Stoneville, MS, USA as described previously. Larvae were selected on a diagnostic dose of 2.0 μg ml-1 purified Cry1Ac, and survivors used to create the strain, HzStark_Cry1AcR.  HzStark_Cry1AcR was back-crossed every 5 generations to a susceptible line maintained at USDA-ARS SIMRU.</p>
<p>A single male pupa (homogametic, ZZ sex chromosome) from HzStark_Cry1AcR was dissected laterally into eight ~20 μg sections.  High molecular weight DNA was extracted. PacBio libraries were generated from unsheared DNA using a SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit 2.0 (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA), and 20 hour run time movies generated on a single SMRT Cell 1M v3 using the Sequel I system (Pacific Biosciences).</p>
<p>The raw continuous long read (CLR) subread bam files were converted to fastq format using bamtools v. 2.5.1 (Barnett et al. 2011), then used as input for the Falcon assembler (Chin et al. 2016) using the pb-assembly conda environment v. 0.0.8.1 (Pacific Biosciences; default parameters). Falcon-Unzip created primary and alternate contigs with one round of haplotype-aware polishing by Arrow (Pacific Biosciences).</p>

Data from: A Community Resource for Exploring and Utilizing Genetic Diversity in the USDA Pea Single Plant Plus Collection,"<p>Included in this dataset are SNP and fasta data for the Pea Single Plant Plus Collection (PSPPC) and the PSPPC augmented with 25 <em>P. fulvum</em> accessions.</p>
<p>These 6 datasets can be roughly divided into two groups. Group 1 consists of three datasets labeled PSPPC which refer to SNP data pertaining to the USDA Pea Single Plant Plus Collection. Group 2 consists of three datasets labeled PSPPC + <em>P. fulvum</em> which refer to SNP data pertaining to the USDA PSPPC with 25 accessions of <em>Pisum fulvum</em> added. SNPs for each of these groups were called independently; therefore SNP names that are shared between the PSPPC and PSPPC + <em>P. fulvum</em> groups should NOT be assumed to refer to the same locus.</p>
<p>For analysis, SNP data is available in two widely used formats: hapmap and vcf. These formats can be successfully loaded into TASSEL v. 5.2.25 (<a href=""http://www.maizegenetics.net/tassel"">http://www.maizegenetics.net/tassel</a>). Explanations of fields (columns) in the VCF files are contained within commented (##) rows at the top of the file.</p>

"Data from: A High-Quality Genome Assembly from a Single, Field-collected Spotted Lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) using the PacBio Sequel II System","<p>A high-quality reference genome is an essential tool for applied and basic research on arthropods. Long-read sequencing technologies may be used to generate more complete and contiguous genome assemblies than alternate technologies, however, long-read methods have historically had greater input DNA requirements and higher costs than next generation sequencing, which are barriers to their use on many samples. Here, we present a 2.3 Gb <em>de novo</em> genome assembly of a field-collected adult female Spotted Lanternfly (<em>Lycorma delicatula</em>) using a single PacBio SMRT Cell. The Spotted Lanternfly is an invasive species recently discovered in the northeastern United States, threatening to damage economically important crop plants in the region. The DNA from one individual female specimen collected in Reading, Berks County, Pennsylvania was used to make one standard, size-selected library with an average DNA fragment size of ~20 kb. The library was run on one Sequel II SMRT Cell 8M, generating a total of 132 Gb of long-read sequences, of which 82 Gb were from unique library molecules, representing approximately 38x coverage of the genome. The assembly had high contiguity (contig N50 length = 1.5 Mb), completeness, and sequence level accuracy as estimated by conserved gene set analysis (96.8% of conserved genes both complete and without frame shift errors). Further, it was possible to segregate more than half of the diploid genome into the two separate haplotypes. The assembly also recovered two microbial symbiont genomes known to be associated with <em>L. delicatula</em>, each microbial genome being assembled into a single contig. We demonstrate that field-collected arthropods can be used for the rapid generation of high-quality genome assemblies, an attractive approach for projects on emerging invasive species, disease vectors, or conservation efforts of endangered species.</p>
<p>Supporting files for the manuscript ""A High-Quality Genome Assembly from a Single, Field-collected Spotted Lanternfly (<em>Lycorma delicatula</em>) using the PacBio Sequel II System"", include several intermediate versions of the assembly (raw output from Falcon, raw output from Falcon unzip, etc.) as well as the final assembly primary contigs and haplotigs (for the regions of the genome that were phased).</p>

<p>Abstract from paper:<br />
Several bumble bee species (<em>Bombus</em> Latreille) are declining and efforts to conserve populations will be strengthened by an improved knowledge of their geographic distribution. Knowledge gaps exist, however, especially in central portions of North America. Here we report 29 species of bumble bees from South Dakota in the north-central USA, based on 130 years of records from 1891 to 2021. Specimens or observations were available for &gt;90% of the 66 counties, though they were not distributed evenly as most records came from Pennington, Lawrence, Custer, Brookings, and Day Counties. The five most commonly collected or reported bumble bee species were <em>B. griseocollis</em> (54 counties), <em>B. pensylvanicus</em> (41 counties), <em>B. fervidus</em> (39 counties), <em>B. huntii</em> (27 counties), and <em>B. bimaculatus</em> (25 counties). Twenty species were recorded from 10 or fewer counties. Despite differences in occurrence, 66% of the <em>Bombus</em> species in South Dakota were collected or observed since 2020, including six of the nine species of conservation concern (<em>B. fraternus, B. pensylvanicus, B. fervidus, B. occidentalis, B. terricola</em>, and <em>B. morrisoni</em>). However, the critically endangered <em>B. affinis, B. variabilis</em>, and <em>B. suckleyi</em> have not been collected or observed for over 50 years. While this checklist is the first for South Dakota bumble bees in nearly 100 years, data are still lacking as ~55% of counties had fewer than five species reported. We suggest future efforts should focus on these under-sampled areas to fill in baseline knowledge of the wild bee fauna towards completing a more holistic view of bumble bee distributions across the Great Plains.</p>

<p>This dataset is supplemental to the article ""A hydrological modeling dataset for the Johnston Draw catchment, Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, Idaho, USA,"" which was submitted to <em>Water Resources Research</em> in December 2015.</p>
<p>The data includes time-series measurements of precipitation at three different gauges (124, 125, and 124b) at the Johnston Draw watershed, a sub-watershed of the Reynolds Creek Critical Zone Observatory. The Johnston Draw watershed was established by the USDA's Agricultural Research Service in 2002 to study the rain-snow transition zone. Data was collected at gauges 124 and 125 from October 1, 2003 through September 30, 2014 and at gauge 124b from November 11, 2006 through September 30, 2014.</p>
<p>Precipitation for 124 and 125 were wind-corrected using the dual-gauge method described by Hanson et al. (2004). Precipitation for 124b was wind-corrected using wind data and the standard World Meteorological Organization (WMO) method as applied by Yang et al. (1999). The percent snow was calculated using the methods developed by Marks et al. (2013), using the during-storm dew point temperature (Td) where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Td &lt; ­‐0.5 °C  100 % Snow</li>
<p>­
<li>‐0.5 °C &gt;= Td &lt; 0 °C  75 % Snow</li>
<li>0 °C &lt;= Td &lt; +0.5 °C  25 % Snow</li>
<li>0.5 °C &lt;= Td  0 % Snow</li>
</ul>
<p>125 and 124b are dual gauge precipitation stations. The pair are modified Belfort Universal gauges, with 124b having a wind shield and 125 remaining unshielded.</p>
<p>Each of the precipitation records is an ASCII comma-separated text file with one header row containing Date_time, WY (Water Year), Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, ppt_s (shielded precipitation; mm), ppt_u (unshielded precipitation; mm), ppt_a (wind corrected precipitation; mm), and pct_snow (percent of precipitation that is snow; %) separated by commas.</p>

Data from: A systematic review of the behavioral responses by stored-product arthropods to individual or blends of microbially-produced volatile cues,"<p>A systematic search of the literature using Google Scholar, (<a href=""https://scholar.google.com/"">https://scholar.google.com/</a>) and Web of Science was used to identify studies that examined the effects of individual compounds or mixtures of MVOCs on the behavioral responses of stored-product arthropods. Stored-product arthropods were defined as those insects and arachnids attacking stored, durable commodities in the post-harvest supply chain at any of the successive links, including storage, transportation, processing, and marketing. Where applicable, we parsed studies into component experiments where behavioral responses or other factors such as type of assays or measured variables may have differed (e.g. dosage, compound, etc.). We classified each test as resulting in statistically significant attraction (+), repellence (−), or neither (○) compared to a negative or positive control. We excluded any studies lacking appropriate negative or positive controls, lacking replication, or lacking sufficient details on the identity of tested substrates to enable appropriate interpretation. Terms used to search databases included the following singly and/or in combination: “fungal”, “volatiles”, “stored products”, “insect behavior”, “insect-microbe”, “interactions”, “semiochemicals”, “mycotoxin”, “behavioral response”, “attraction”, and “postharvest”, and combinations thereof. In addition, we kept track of methodology used for tests, response variables, target insect, insect stage, and microbial taxon. We split our analysis up between tests with complex (but usually uncharacterized) blends of MVOCs, and those with known individual or known component mixtures of MVOCs.</p>

Data from: An Exploratory Analysis of Barriers to Usage of the USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans,"<p>The average American’s diet does not align with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2020). The present study aimed to compare fruit and vegetable consumption among those who had and had not heard of the DGA, identify characteristics of DGA users, and identify barriers to DGA use. A nationwide survey of 943 Americans revealed that those who had heard of the DGA ate more fruits and vegetables than those who had not. Men, African Americans, and those who have more education had greater odds of using the DGA as a guide when preparing meals relative to their respective counterparts. Disinterest, effort, and time were among the most cited reasons for not using the DGA. Future research should examine how to increase DGA adherence among those unaware of or who do not use the DGA.</p>
<p>Comparative analyses of fruit and vegetable consumption among those who were aware/unaware and use/do not use the DGA were completed using independent samples t tests. Fruit and vegetable consumption variables were log-transformed for analysis.

Data from: An In Vitro Combined Antibiotic-Antibody Treatment Eliminates Toxicity from Shiga Toxin-Producing Escherichia coli,"<p>Treating Shiga toxin-producing <em>Escherichia coli</em> (STEC) gastrointestinal infections is difficult. The utility of antibiotics for STEC treatment is controversial, since antibiotic resistance among STEC isolates is widespread and certain antibiotics dramatically increase the expression of Shiga toxins (Stxs), which are some of the most important virulence factors in STEC. Stxs contribute to life-threatening hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), which develops in considerable proportions of patients with STEC infections. Understanding the antibiotic resistance profiles of STEC isolates and the Stx induction potential of promising antibiotics is essential for evaluating any antibiotic treatment of STEC. In this study, 42 O157:H7 or non-O157 STEC isolates (including the “big six” serotypes) were evaluated for their resistance against 22 antibiotics by using an antibiotic array. Tigecycline inhibited the growth of all of the tested STEC isolates and also inhibited the production of Stxs (Stx2 in particular). In combination with neutralizing antibodies to Stx1 and Stx2, the tigecycline-antibody treatment fully protected Vero cells from Stx toxicity, even when the STEC bacteria and the Vero cells were cultured together. The combination of an antibiotic such as tigecycline with neutralizing antibodies presents a promising strategy for future STEC treatments.</p>

"Data from: Analysis of expressed sequence tags from a significant livestock pest, the stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans), identifies transcripts with a putative role in chemosensation and sex determination.","<p>The stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans L. (Diptera: Muscidae), is one of the most significant pests of livestock in the United States. The identification of targets for the development of novel control for this pest species, focusing on those molecules that play a role in successful feeding and reproduction, is critical to mitigating its impact on confined and rangeland livestock. This data set was obtained from pyrosequencing of stable fly immature and adult specimens, comprising genes expressed at these stages. Stable fly specimens were obtained from an in vitro colony that is maintained at the Knipling-Bushland U.S. Livestock Insects Research Laboratory (Kerrville, TX) at 27°C, 60% RH, and a photoperiod of 12:12 [L:D] h. The stages included 1 g each of newly laid (t0) and 24 h post-oviposition (t24) embryos, 5 g of pooled 2nd–3rd instar larvae (late larvae), 2.5 g newly pupariated pupae (early pupae), 5 g pharate adults (pupae 2 d prior to eclosion; late pupae), and 1.5 g each of heads from unfed adult females and males (adult). Total RNA was isolated from various stages using the ToTALLY RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Foster City, CA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Five micrograms of normalized cDNA was prepared for sequencing on the 454/ Roche GS-FLX. Double-stranded cDNA was nebulized to generate nominal 500-kb fragments and a shotgun library prepared for GS-FLX sequencing as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). The sequencing library was run on a full picotitre plate and resulting data submitted to NCBI Short Read Archive (SRX018014). The resulting sequence data was assembled using newbler (RocheN) and the assembly optimized using a beta version of NGEN (DNAstar, Madison, WI) and Seqman (DNAstar, Oxford, UK).

Data from: Apple flower detection using deep convolutional networks,"<p>To optimize fruit production, a portion of the flowers and fruitlets of apple trees must be removed early in the growing season. The proportion to be removed is determined by the bloom intensity, i.e., the number of flowers present in the orchard. Several automated computer vision systems have been proposed to estimate bloom intensity, but their overall performance is still far from satisfactory even in relatively controlled environments. With the goal of devising a technique for flower identification which is robust to clutter and to changes in illumination, this paper presents a method in which a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) is fine-tuned to become specially sensitive to flowers. Experimental results on a challenging dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms three approaches that represent the state of the art in flower detection, with recall and precision rates higher than 90%. Moreover, a performance assessment on three additional datasets previously unseen by the network, which consist of different flower species and were acquired under different conditions, reveals that the proposed method highly surpasses baseline approaches in terms of generalization capability.  This dataset comprises mp4 video sequences illustrating each combination of datasets and methods.</p>

Data from: Assessing metabolomic and chemical diversity of a soybean lineage representing 35 years of breeding,"<p>Information on crop genotype- and phenotype-metabolite associations can be of value to trait development as well as to food security and safety. The unique study presented here assessed seed metabolomic and ionomic diversity in a soybean (<em>Glycine max</em>) lineage representing ~35 years of breeding (launch years 1972–2008) and increasing yield potential. Selected varieties included six conventional and three genetically modified (GM) glyphosate-tolerant lines. A metabolomics approach utilizing capillary electrophoresis (CE)-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (TOF-MS), gas chromatography (GC)-TOF-MS and liquid chromatography (LC)-quadrupole (q)-TOFMS resulted in measurement of a total of 732 annotated peaks. Ionomics through inductively-coupled plasma (ICP)-MS profiled twenty mineral elements. Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) of the seed data successfully differentiated newer higher-yielding soybean from earlier lower-yielding accessions at both field sites. This result reflected genetic fingerprinting data that demonstrated a similar distinction between the newer and older soybean. Correlation analysis also revealed associations between yield data and specific metabolites. There were no clear metabolic differences between the conventional and GM lines. Overall, observations of metabolic and genetic differences between older and newer soybean varieties provided novel and significant information on the impact of varietal development on biochemical variability. Proposed applications of omics in food and feed safety assessments will need to consider that GM is not a major source of metabolite variability and that trait development in crops will, of necessity, be associated with biochemical variation.</p>

Data from: Association mapping of agronomic and quality traits in USDA pea single-plant collection,"<p>Association mapping is an efficient approach for the identification of the molecular basis of agronomic traits in crop plants. For this purpose in pea (<em>Pisum sativum</em> L.), we genotyped and phenotyped individual lines of the single-plant-derived core collection of the USDA pea collection including accessions from 330 landraces and cultivars of <em>Pisum sativum</em> subsp. <em>sativum</em> var. <em>sativum</em>, 28 <em>P. sativum</em> subsp. <em>elatius</em> var. <em>elatius</em>, 16 <em>P. sativum</em> subsp. <em>sativum</em> var. <em>arvense</em>, four <em>P. sativum</em> subsp. <em>elatius</em> var. <em>pumilio</em>, three <em>P. abyssinicum</em>, two <em>P. fulvum</em>, and one <em>P. sativum</em> subsp. <em>transcaucasicum</em>. These 384 accessions were collected or donated from a total of 64 countries. The accessions were genotyped with 256 informative SNPs using a primer extension chemistry and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI–TOF) mass spectrometry assay. Genetic structure analysis showed that the collection was structured into two main groups, corresponding roughly to the cultivated types/landraces and the more primitive form species and subspecies, with some intermediates. Linkage disequilibrium of pairwise loci and population structure of the collection were analyzed, and an association analysis between SNP genotypes and 25 valuable traits such as disease resistance, seed type/color, flower color, seed low molecular weight carbohydrate concentration, and seed mineral nutrient concentration was performed using a mixed linear model. A total of 71 marker–trait associations were detected as significant with 1–34 markers per trait based on the false discovery rate (FDR &lt; 0.05).

Data from: Association mapping of resistance to tan spot in the Global Durum Panel,"<p>Phenotypic data<br />
A total of 510 lines from the global durum panel (GDP) were evaluated for reaction to five isolates of the fungal pathogen <em>Pyrenophora tritici-repentis</em>. The five isolates were Pti2 (race 1), 86-124 (race 2), 331-9 (race 3), L13-192 (race 4), and DW5 (race 5). The GDP lines were inoculated in a greenhouse when plants were at the two- or three-leaf stage. Plants were grown in a randomized complete block design consisting of one replicate per experiment, and each experiment was repeated three times. Following inoculation, the plants were placed in misting chambers with 100% relative humidity at 21 °C for 24 h, and then placed in a growth chamber under a 12-h photoperiod at 21 °C. Disease reactions were scored 7 days after inoculation following the 1–5 scale where 1 was highly resistant and 5 was highly susceptible.</p>
<p>Seedlings of the GDP were also infiltrated with cultures containing the necrotrophic effectors (NEs) Ptr ToxA and Ptr ToxB. Approximately 20 μl of NE-containing culture filtrate (CF) was infiltrated into two plants (1 leaf per plant) in each cone using a needleless 1-ml syringe. The infiltrated area (~3 cm) was marked with permanent marker on the leaves, and the plants were placed in a growth chamber (21 °C, 12-h photoperiod) for 5 days. The reactions were scored using a 0–3 scale where 0 indicated no reaction and 3 indicated severe necrosis or chlorosis. The expansion of chlorosis beyond the boundaries of Ptr ToxB infiltration to the distal end of the leaf was scored separately using 0 or 1 meaning the absence or presence of the symptom, respectively. This trait is noted as ‘ToxB_Spread’ in the data file.</p>
<p>Genotypic data<br />
The GDP lines were genotyped using the Illumina iSelect 90K SNP array. Markers were filtered using previously published genetic maps, and marker sequences were aligned to the Svevo.v1 reference genome. SNP imputation was performed, and the redundant markers were pruned based on genome wide linkage disequilibrium, which resulted in a data set with no missing SNP calls.

"Data from: Attracted by higher crude protein, grasshopper abundance and offtake increase after prescribed fire","<p>This study examined how indirect fire effects (improved forage quality) affect the density of and offtake by grasshoppers at two different times since fire and in unburned plots. Data include total aboveground forage removal inside and outside grasshopper exclosures, crude protein content of aboveground plant material, and grasshopper densities throughout the study period. Both forage offtake and grasshopper density were significantly higher in burned plots compared to unburned plots. Burned plot grasshopper density increased over time, with greater rates of increase in recently burned plots, while density remained constant in unburned locations. These density and offtake patterns appear to be the result of higher crude protein content in burned plots, on account of them having a much higher proportion of recent growth after fire removed aboveground senesced material.</p>

"Data from: Attraction, mobility, and preference by Lasioderma serricorne (F.) (Coleoptera: Ptinidae) to microbially-mediated volatile emissions by two species of fungi in stored grain","<p>Our goals were to 1) isolate, and culture two fungal morphotypes, 2) characterize the volatile emissions from grain inoculated by each fungal morphotype (<em>Aspergillus flavus</em> or <em>Fusarium</em> spp.) compared to uninoculated and sanitized grain, and 3) understand how MVOCs from each morphotype affects mobility, attraction, and preference by <em>L. serricorne</em>. Headspace collection revealed that the <em>Fusarium</em>- and <em>A. flavus</em>-inoculated grain produced significantly different volatiles compared to sanitized grain or the positive control. Changes in MVOC emissions affected close-range foraging during an Ethovision assay, with a greater frequency of entering and spending time in a small zone with kernels inoculated with <em>A. flavus</em> compared to other treatments. In the release-recapture assay, MVOCs were found to be attractive to <em>L. serricorne</em> at a longer distances in commercial pitfall traps. While there was no preference shown among semiochemical stimuli in a still-air, four-way olfactometer, it is possible that methodological limitations prevented robust interpretation from this assay. Overall, our study suggests that MVOCs are important for close- and long-range orientation of <em>L.serricorne</em> during foraging, and that MVOCs may have the potential for inclusion in behaviorally-based tactics for this species.</p>

Data from: Bacterial communities and prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes carried within house flies (Diptera: Muscidae) associated with beef and dairy cattle farms,"<p>House flies (<em>Musca domestica</em> L.) are vectors of human and animal pathogens at livestock operations. Microbial communities in flies are acquired from, and correlate with, their local environment. However, variation among microbial communities carried by flies from farms in different geographical areas is not well understood. We characterized bacterial communities of female house flies collected from beef and dairy farms in Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska and further evaluated the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in bacteria within flies. We evaluated the influence of farm type and farm location on bacterial communities, diversity, pathogenic bacteria strains and prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes. These data can be used for better understanding of abundance and prevalence of bacterial communities in house flies associated with livestock operations. These data were collected in September 2019. Abbreviations used include Operational Taxonomic Units(OTUs), Canonical Correspondence analysis (CCA), Infectious Bovine Keratoconjunctivitis (IBK), Anti Microbial Resistance (AMR), and Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs).</p>

Data from: Benzoxazinoids in roots and shoots of cereal rye (Secale cereale) and their fates in soil after cover crop termination,"<p>Cover crops provide many agroecosystem services, including weed suppression, which is partially exerted through release of allelopathic benzoxazinoid (BX) compounds. This research characterizes (1) changes in concentrations of BX compounds in shoots, roots, and soil at three growth stages (GS) of cereal rye (<em>Secale cereale</em> L.), and (2) their degradation over time following termination. Concentrations of shoot dominant BX compounds, DIBOA-glc and DIBOA, were least at GS 83 (boot). The root dominant BX compound, HMBOA-glc, concentration was least at GS 54 (elongation). Rhizosphere soil BX concentrations were 1000 times smaller than in root tissues. Dominant compounds in soil were HMBOA-glc and HMBOA. Concentrations of BX compounds were similar for soil near root crowns and between-rows. Soil BX concentrations following cereal rye termination declined exponentially over time in three of four treatments: incorporated shoots (S) and roots (R), no-till S+R (cereal rye rolled flat), and no-till R (shoots removed), but not in no-till S. On the day following cereal rye termination, soil concentrations of HMBOA-glc and HMBOA in these three treatments increased above initial concentrations. Concentrations of these two compounds decreased the fastest while DIBOA-glc declined the slowest (half-life of 4 d in no-till S+R soil). Placement of shoots on the surface of an area where cereal rye had not grown (no-till S) did not increase soil concentrations of BX compounds. The short duration and complex dynamics of BX compounds in soil prior to and following termination illustrate the limited window for enhancing weed suppression by cereal rye allelochemicals; valuable information for programs breeding for enhanced weed suppression.</p>

Data from: Biochar stability in a highly weathered sandy soil under four years of continuous corn production,"<p>This is digital research metadata corresponding to a published manuscript in Energies (MDPI) entitled ""Biochar stability in a highly weathered sandy soil under four years of continuous corn production"", Volume 14, Issue 19, 6157. Dataset may be accessed via the included link at the Dryad data repository.</p>
<p>Biochar is being considered a climate change mitigation tool by increasing soil organic carbon contents (SOC), however, questions remain concerning its longevity in soil. We applied 30,000 kg ha−1 of biochars to plots containing a Goldsboro sandy loam (Fine-loamy, siliceous, sub-active, thermic Aquic Paleudults) and then physically disked all plots. Thereafter, the plots were agronomically managed under 4 years (Y) of continuous corn (<em>Zea mays</em>, L.) planting. Annually, incremental soil along with corresponding bulk density samples were collected and SOC concentrations were measured in topsoil (down to 23-cm). The biochars were produced from Lodgepole pine (<em>Pinus contorta</em>) chip (PC) and Poultry litter (PL) feedstocks. An untreated Goldsboro soil (0 biochar) served as a control. After four years, SOC contents in the biochar treated plots were highest in the top 0–5 and 5–10 cm depth suggesting minimal deeper movement. Declines in SOC contents varied with depth and biochar type. After correction for SOC declines in controls, PL biochar treated soil had a similar decline in SOC (7.9 to 10.3%) contents. In contrast, the largest % SOC content decline (20.2%) occurred in 0–5 cm deep topsoil treated with PC biochar. Our results suggest that PC biochar had less stability in the Goldsboro soil than PL biochar after 4 years of corn grain production.</p>

Data from: Bivalent hemagglutinin and neuraminidase influenza replicon particle vaccines protect without causing vaccine associated enhanced respiratory disease in swine,"<p>Influenza A virus is a major respiratory pathogen in swine that leads to significant economic loss in the swine industry, and there is a critical need to improve on commercial vaccines. Traditional vaccines target the hemagglutinin (HA) portion of the IAV virus, lose protection to as viruses change, and may even lead to vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) after infection with a dissimilar influenza virus. A newer replicon particle (RP) vaccine platform targeting the influenza HA protein offers multiple advantages over traditional vaccines for swine, but have not yet been evaluated for the ability to avoid VAERD or the use of HA along with an additional viral vaccine target, such as neuraminidase (NA). In this work we demonstrated RP HA and NA influenza vaccines stimulate immune responses, protect from disease, and avoid VAERD following infection with a distantly related virus. This demonstrates the potential utility of RP vaccines against influenza and the importance in utilizing the NA in influenza vaccine design. Such improvement of IAV vaccines will reduce influenza disease and economic loss in commercial swine and reduce the risk of influenza transmission to people. These data include individual pig responses used in statistical analyses and figures to support the conclusions of the paper.</p>

Data from: Can measurements of foraging behaviour predict variation in weight gains of free-ranging cattle?,"<p>Technologies are now available to continuously monitor livestock foraging behaviours, but it remains unclear whether such measurements can meaningfully inform livestock grazing management decisions. Empirical studies in extensive rangelands are needed to quantify relationships between short-term foraging behaviours (e.g. minutes to days) and longer-term measures of animal performance.  The objective of this study was to examine whether four different ways of measuring daily foraging behaviour (grazing-bout duration, grazing time per day, velocity while grazing, and turn angle while grazing) were related to weight gain by free-ranging yearling steers grazing semiarid rangeland.  These data include measurements interpreted from yearling steer outfitted with neck collars supporting a solar-powered device that measured GPS locations at 5 minute intervals and used an accelerometer to predict grazing activity at 4 second intervals.  Average daily weight gains of steers are included as well as an estimate of standing forage biomass derived from the Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel remote-sensing product.  These data support research to advance knowledge regarding the use of on-animal sensors that monitor foraging behaviour, which have the potential to transmit indicators to livestock managers in real time (e.g. daily).  This approach can help inform decisions such as when to move animals among paddocks, or when to sell or transition animals from rangeland to confined feeding operations.</p>

A study was conducted to quantify carbon balance of a spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-corn-soybean rotation under no-till management using eddy covariance techniques over a 3-yr period. Paired field sites with the same soil type near Mandan, ND USA were used for the study. Data from the study included fluxes of carbon dioxide and water vapor, precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, photosynthetically active radiation, soil temperature, soil water content, vegetation phenology, green chromatic coordinate, aboveground biomass, leaf area index, and grain yield. Data were used to generate estimates of net ecosystem exchange, ecosystem respiration, gross ecosystem production, net ecosystem carbon balance, evapotranspiration, vapor pressure deficit, relative greenness of vegetation, and carbon-, water-, and light-use efficiencies. Data are generally applicable to rainfed conditions under a semiarid Continental climate for Temvik-Wilton silt loams (fine silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic and Pachic Haplustolls) and related soil types (i.e., Grassna, Linton, Mandan, and Williams).</p>

<p>Linum lewisii, a perennial blue flax native to North America, holds potential as a sustainable perennial crop for oilseed production due to its ecological adaptability, upright harvestable structure, nutritious seeds, and low insect and disease issues. Its native distribution spans a large geographic range, from the Pacific Coast to the Mississippi River, and from Alaska to Baja California. Tolerant to cold and drought conditions, this species is also important for native ecosystem rehabilitation. Its enhancement of soil health, support for pollinators, and carbon sequestration underscore its agricultural relevance.</p>
<p>This study presents a high-quality, chromosome-scale assembly of the L. lewisii (2n = 2x = 18) genome, derived from PacBio HiFi and Dovetail Omni-C sequencing of the “Maple Grove” variety. The initial assembly contained 642,903,787 base pairs across 2,924 scaffolds. Following HiRise scaffolding, the final assembly contained 643,041,835 base pairs, across 1,713 scaffolds, yielding an N50 contig length of 66,209,717 base pairs. Annotation of the assembly revealed 38,808 genes, including 37,599 protein-coding genes and 7,108 putative transposable elements. Analysis of synteny with other flax species revealed a striking number of chromosomal rearrangements. We also found an intriguing absence of the single-copy TSS1 gene in the L. lewisii genome, potentially linked to its transition from heterostyly to homostyly.</p>
<p>Taken together, these findings represent a significant advancement in our understanding of the Linum genus and provide a resource for future domestication efforts and basic research on Lewis flax.</p>

Data from: Classical biological control and apparent competition: evaluating a waterhyacinth invaded community module,"<p>The scope and complexity of interactions within community food webs necessitates their simplification to a community module scale for conducting empirical studies. An outdoor mesocosm study in the USA quantified the strengths of direct and indirect interactions between two herbivore congeners that fed on two aquatic plant species while sharing a parasitoid. <em>Kalopolynema ema</em> (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) is a stenophagous native egg parasitoid that attacks the hemipteran species in this study, <em>Megamelus davisi</em> (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), a native herbivore that feeds on the native aquatic species <em>Nuphar advena</em>, and the introduced biological control agent <em>Megamelus scutellaris</em> (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) that feeds on the non-native aquatic species waterhyacinth, <em>Pontederia crassipes</em>. The presence of <em>M. scutellaris</em> did not significantly increase parasitism of <em>M. davisi</em> indicating that apparent competition was not a factor in this community module. There was no evidence of any trophic cascades caused by these interactions based on the relative growth rates of biomass and leaf area for both plant species. The relative strengths of interactions varied with herbivore densities suggesting that should negative indirect effects occur they would likely be transient and closely linked to population dynamics as influenced by abiotic factors like temperature.  The primary negative interaction was biotic resistance to <em>Megamelus scutellaris</em> from attack by <em>Kalopolynema ema</em>. Despite identifying potential negative interactions using path analysis, we saw no apparent competition following the insertion of a weed biological control agent into a community that contains an ecological analog.</p>

Data from: Comparison of different traps and attractants in three food processing facilities in Greece on the capture of stored product insects,"<p>We compared all combinations of three commercial traps and five different attractants on the capture of stored-product insects for two consecutive years in three food processing facilities in Central Greece. Specifically, Facility 1 and 2 were pasta factories and Facility 3 was a flour mill. The traps that were used in the experiments were Dome Trap (Trécé Inc., USA), Wall Trap (Trécé Inc., USA) and Box Trap (Insects Limited, Ltd., USA). The attractants that were evaluated were 0.13 g of : 1) of PantryPatrol gel (Insects Limited, Inc., USA), 2) Storgard kairomone food attractant oil (Trece Inc.), 3) wheat germ (Honeyville, USA), 4) Dermestid tablet attractant (Insects Limited Inc., USA). The traps were inspected approximately every 15 days and rotated clockwise. The captured insects were transferred to the Laboratory of Entomology and Agricultural Zoology (LEAZ) at University of Thessaly for identification. The results indicated that there was a wide range of species within the three facilities throughout the trapping period, with the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Hübner), the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) and the cigarette beetle, Lasioderma serricorne (F.), being the most abundant. Although there were noticeable differences among the different traps and attractants for the capture of certain species, all combinations provided comparable population fluctuation patterns. In general, Dome traps, baited with either the oil or the gel, were found to be the most effective.</p>
<p>There are not much data available so far for the simultaneous comparable use of different trapping devices and different attractants in commercial facilities for long-term monitoring. Certain lures are marketed toward particular pests or classes of pests, while others might be more generic, multi-species lures. To shed light on this issue, we evaluated a series of combinations of floor traps and attractants, in three commercial facilities in Greece, for a period of two years. Our questions included both which trap was broadly most effective as well as whether different combinations of traps and types of attractants were delivering novel information about the stored product insect community. The traps include two types of floor traps, and the wall trap used in the USDA khapra beetle detection programs. The lures included the Insects Limited ™ dermestid tab that is more specifically focused on food kairomones for only that taxon, and the same company’s PantryPatrol gel, which uses wheat kairomones and the pheromones of multiple species, including dermestids. We also use the Trécé Storgard kairomone oil, and simple wheat germ, which are both multi-species kairomones with no pheromones.</p>

<strong>Resource Description:</strong><br />
2.1 Storage facilities<br />
The storage facilities in which this study took place are located in Central Greece. The selection of these facilities was based on their size, the accessibility from University of Thessaly (UTH) personnel and the known historical presence of stored product insect species and other arthropods. The sampling was conducted in three types of storage facilities refereed as Facility 1, Facility 2 and Facility 3. Facilities 1 and 2 are pasta factories, with substantial quantities of soft and hard wheat, flour and bran, but also some barley and maize, while Facility 3 is a flour mill, mostly focused on soft wheat processing. The deployment of the traps on each facility was conducted at 18 June 2018, 4 July 2018, and 3 July 2018 for Facility 1, 2 and 3, respectively.<br />
2.2. Traps, attractants and inspection<br />
The trap types that were used in our experiments were Dome Trap (Trécé Inc., USA), Wall Trap (Trécé Inc., USA) and Box Trap (Insects Limited, Ltd., USA). These traps have been proven effective for monitoring purposes based on previous studies (Toews et al., 2009; Athanassiou and Arthur, 2018; Gerken and Campbell, 2021).<br />
Four attractants (noted also as lures) were used in our experiments, which were 0.13 g: 1) PantryPatrol gel (gel, Insects Limited, Inc., USA), 2) Storgard™ Oil kairomone food attractant (oil, Trécé Inc.), 3) wheat germ (WG, Honeyville, USA), 4) Dermestid tablet attractant (bait, Insects Limited Inc., USA). Also, an additional series of traps was used without any attractant, and served as “control” (e.g., ctrl). In Facility 1, the different traps and attractant combinations were replicated two times. In Facilities 2 and 3, the combinations were replicated three times, based on larger space availability. For each Facility, the traps were inspected approx. every 15 days, with the exception of some intervals where access to the trapping areas was not possible (e.g. due to fumigations in certain areas etc.). The traps were rotated clockwise after each inspection. The attractants were replaced at 15-day intervals, while the traps were replaced whenever it was considered necessary (damaged or lost traps). All captured insects were transferred to the Laboratory of Entomology and Agricultural Zoology (LEAZ), Department of Agriculture, Crop Protection and Rural Environment, University of Thessaly.<br />
2.3 Identification<br />
The morphological identification of the captured individuals was carried out up to the species level, or lowest taxonomic unit, whenever this was possible using taxonomic keys, but in general many specimens are referred to as taxa. The insects found were classified into species (species identification) using different taxonomic keys (Bousquet, 1990; Peacock, 1993; USDA 1991).</p>

"Data from: Compound hydroclimatic extremes in a semi-arid grassland: Drought, deluge and the carbon cycle","<p>These data were generated to evaluate the effects of compound hydroclimatic extremes – a deluge during drought – on production and carbon cycling in a semi-arid (shortgrass steppe) grassland in Colorado (USA). The study experimentally imposed an extreme drought and then interrupted this drought with either a single extreme deluge event or the equivalent amount of precipitation provided in several smaller events. This design, focused on how the combined effects of extreme drought and deluge altered productivity and carbon cycling relative to a control treatment receiving ambient rainfall and a drought treatment that received an equal amount of precipitation delivered as events more typical of contemporary rainfall regimes.</p>
<p>Research was conducted at the 6,500 ha USDA-Central Plains Experimental Range (CPER), which is part of the Long-Term Agroecosystem Research network (LTAR; 2012-present; <a href=""https://ltar.ars.usda.gov/"">https://ltar.ars.usda.gov/</a>), a former Long-Term Ecological Research station (LTER, 1983-2012), and located in the shortgrass steppe of north-central Colorado, USA. Additional information and referenced materials about many of the long-term studies initiated on the CPER can be found: <a href=""https://dx.doi.org/10.25675/10217/81141"">https://dx.doi.org/10.25675/10217/81141</a>.</p>
<p>During the 2019 growing season (May-Aug), four precipitation treatments were randomly assigned to forty 1 m^2 plots spaced 2 m apart (n = 10 per precipitation treatment). Precipitation was excluded during the growing season by installing clear plastic roofs (2.2 x 2.2 m) over each plot and then added water to simulate four precipitation treatments: 1. a control treatment (“CON”; based on the exact pattern and amount that occurred at the site in 1989 – a year with an average precipitation regime, see below), 2. a drought treatment (“DRT”; a 77.5% reduction in each event added to the control plots), 3. a drought plus deluge treatment (“DRT+DEL”; the DRT treatment with a 60 mm deluge added mid-July) and 4. a drought plus small events treatment (“DRT+SE”; the DRT treatment, with a total of 60 mm of precipitation added to nine events from mid-July through mid-August).</p>
<p>Over the course of the experiment, four response variables were measured: soil moisture, greenness, carbon fluxes, and productivity. Soil moisture was measured weekly from 0-100 cm at 10 cm increments using a Sentek Diviner probe on a subset of plots (n=3 per treatment), using a site-based calibration to calculate volumetric water content. Weekly plot canopy greenness was estimated using repeat digital photography, by calculating the average green chromatic coordinates (GCC) of the pixels in each photograph. Carbon flux measurements were conducted on a subset of plots (n = 5) using a custom portable flux chamber (0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 m) attached to a LI-6400. During each measurement, data were logged over a 2 min period to collect the light measurement (net ecosystem exchange; NEE), then the chamber was vented for 7 sec and another measurement was taken during a 2 min period of darkness imposed by an opaque chamber cover (ecosystem respiration; ER). After collection, the data were processed, and the last 30 sec of the measurement were averaged to produce a single value for NEE and ER per measurement. Gross primary production (GPP) was calculated as GPP = NEE – ER.  Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) was measured in all plots (n = 10 per treatment) at the end of the growing season (mid-September). In each plot, all plant material from two 0.1 m^2 subplots was harvested to ground height. Belowground net primary production (BNPP) was estimated as fine root mass production measured using root ingrowth cores. Net primary production (NPP) was estimated by summing ANPP and BNPP from each plot.</p>

Data from: Condition‐dependent co‐regulation of genomic clusters of virulence factors in the grapevine trunk pathogen Neofusicoccum parvum,"<p>The ascomycete <em>Neofusicoccum parvum</em>, one of the causal agents of Botryosphaeria dieback, is a destructive wood‐infecting fungus and a serious threat to grape production worldwide. The capability to colonize woody tissue, combined with the secretion of phytotoxic compounds, is thought to underlie its pathogenicity and virulence. Here, we describe the repertoire of virulence factors and their transcriptional dynamics as the fungus feeds on different substrates and colonizes the woody stem. We assembled and annotated a highly contiguous genome using single‐molecule real‐time DNA sequencing. Transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing determined the genome‐wide patterns of expression of virulence factors both <em>in vitro</em> (potato dextrose agar or medium amended with grape wood as substrate) and <em>in planta</em>. Pairwise statistical testing of differential expression, followed by co‐expression network analysis, revealed that physically clustered genes coding for putative virulence functions were induced depending on the substrate or stage of plant infection. Co‐expressed gene clusters were significantly enriched not only in genes associated with secondary metabolism, but also in those associated with cell wall degradation, suggesting that dynamic co‐regulation of transcriptional networks contributes to multiple aspects of <em>N. parvum</em> virulence. In most of the co‐expressed clusters, all genes shared at least a common motif in their promoter region, indicative of co‐regulation by the same transcription factor. Co‐expression analysis also identified chromatin regulators with correlated expression with inducible clusters of virulence factors, suggesting a complex, multi‐layered regulation of the virulence repertoire of <em>N. parvum</em>.</p>

Data from: Conservation Practices Induce Tradeoffs in Soil Function: Observations from the Northern Great Plains,"<p>Cropland expansion and reduced crop rotation diversity throughout the northern Great Plains has negatively impacted soil quality, creating a need to identify conservation practices that can counteract this trend. A study was conducted to quantify soil property responses to crop diversity/intensity, cover crops, and livestock integration under controlled experimental conditions, and land use (dryland cropping, native grassland, untilled pasture) on working farms and ranches, all on a common soil type in southcentral North Dakota, USA. Data from this study included near-surface (0-5 cm) measurements of soil physical, chemical, and biological properties over a 3-yr period for contrasting long-term experimental treatments at the USDA-ARS Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory, Mandan, North Dakota. Soil profile (0-100 cm) assessments of soil physical and chemical properties complemented near-surface measurements. Data were used to generate soil quality index scores using the Soil Management Assessment Framework. Annual spring wheat grain yields for experimental treatments complemented soils data. Similar evaluations were conducted on six on-farm sites in Emmons County, North Dakota, USA, but only for one year and without grain yield data. Data may be used to better understand soil property responses to cropland conservation practices and different land uses. Data are generally applicable to rainfed conditions under a semiarid Continental climate for Temvik-Wilton silt loams (fine silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic and Pachic Haplustolls) and associated soil types (i.e., Grassna, Linton, Mandan, and Williams).</p>

Data from: Construction of a High-Density American Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) Composite Map Using Genotyping-by-Sequencing for Multi-pedigree Linkage Mapping,"<p>The American cranberry (<em>Vaccinium macrocarpon</em> Ait.) is a recently domesticated, economically important, fruit crop with limited molecular resources. New genetic resources could accelerate genetic gain in cranberry through characterization of its genomic structure and by enabling molecular-assisted breeding strategies. To increase the availability of cranberry genomic resources, genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) was used to discover and genotype thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within three interrelated cranberry full-sib populations. Additional simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci were added to the SNP datasets and used to construct bin maps for the parents of the populations, which were then merged to create the first high-density cranberry composite map containing 6073 markers (5437 SNPs and 636 SSRs) on 12 linkage groups (LGs) spanning 1124 cM. Interestingly, higher rates of recombination were observed in maternal than paternal gametes. The large number of markers in common (mean of 57.3) and the high degree of observed collinearity (mean Pair-wise Spearman rank correlations &gt;0.99) between the LGs of the parental maps demonstrates the utility of GBS in cranberry for identifying polymorphic SNP loci that are transferable between pedigrees and populations in future trait-association studies. Furthermore, the high-density of markers anchored within the component maps allowed identification of segregation distortion regions, placement of centromeres on each of the 12 LGs, and anchoring of genomic scaffolds. Collectively, the results represent an important contribution to the current understanding of cranberry genomic structure and to the availability of molecular tools for future genetic research and breeding efforts in cranberry.</p>

"Data from: Cover cropping history affects cotton boll distribution, lint yields, and fiber quality","<p>This is digital research data corresponding to a published manuscript, Cover cropping history affects cotton boll distribution, lint yields, and fiber quality, in Crop Science, Vol. 63 p. 1209–1220.</p>
<p>There has been limited introduction of new cover crop species into cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production within the last 30 years. Mounting evidence shows that traditional cover cropping species may be detrimental to cotton production, either by depleting soil fertility with crop removal, immobilizing minerals from high carbon residue, or excessive quantity of residue remaining at planting. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of growing a novel cover crop species, carinata (Brassica carinata A. Braun), as a winter annual cover crop for cotton rotation in the southeastern Coastal Plain. Over a 2-year period, carinata, winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and fallow covers were maintained over winter months, then rotated into cotton. Each year, seedcotton and lint yields were collected, along with subsamples for ginning and subsequent fiber quality analyses. Additionally, end-of-season plant mapping was conducted on plants from 1-m of row per plot to determine cover crop effects on boll formation, retention, and distribution, as well as canopy architecture.</p>

Data from: Dataset of de novo assembly and functional annotation of the transcriptome of blueberry (Vaccinium spp.),"<p>Blueberry is an economically important berry crop. Both production and consumption of blueberries have increased sharply worldwide in recent years at least partly due to their known health benefits. The development of improved genomic resources for blueberry, such as a well-assembled genome and transcriptome, could accelerate breeding through genomic-assisted approaches. To enrich available transcriptome data and identify genes potentially involved in fruit quality, RNA sequencing was performed on fruit tissue from two northern-adapted hybrid blueberry breeding populations. RNA-seq was carried out using the Illumina HiSeqTM 2500 platform. Because of the absence of a reference-grade genome for blueberry, a transcriptome was de novo assembled from this RNA-seq data and other publicly available transcriptome data from blueberry downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Short Read Archive (SRA) using Trinity. After removing redundancy, this resulted in a dataset of 91,861 blueberry unigenes. This unigene dataset was functionally annotated using the NCBI-Nr protein database. All raw reads from the breeding populations were deposited in the NCBI SRA with accession numbers SRR6281886, SRR6281887, SRR6281888, and SRR6281889. The de novo transcriptome assembly was deposited at NCBI Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) database with accession number GGAB00000000. These data will provide real expression evidence for the blueberry genome gene prediction and gene functional annotation and a reference transcriptome for future gene expression studies involving blueberry fruit.</p>

Data from: Datasets for transcriptomic analyses of maize leaves in response to Asian corn borer feeding and/or jasmonic acid,"<p>Corn (<em>Zea mays</em>) is one of the most widely grown crops throughout the world. However, many corn fields develop pest problems such as corn borers every year that seriously affect its yield and quality. Corn's response to initial insect damage involves a variety of changes to the levels of defensive enzymes, toxins, and communicative volatiles. Such a dramatic change secondary metabolism necessitates the regulation of gene expression at the transcript level. This <em>Data In Brief</em> paper summarizes the datasets of the transcriptome of corn plants in response to corn stalk borers (<em>Ostrinia furnacalis</em>) and/or methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Altogether, 39, 636 genes were found to be differentially expressed. The sequencing data are available in the NCBI SRA database under accession number SRS965087. This dataset will provide more scientific and valuable information for future work such as the study of the functions of important genes or proteins and develop new insect-resistant maize varieties. Includes supplementary tables and data in fasta and GTF format.</p>

Data from: Decoupled recovery of ecological communities after reclamation,"<p>Grassland restoration is largely focused on creating plant communities that match reference conditions. However, these communities reflect only a subset of the biodiversity of grassland systems. We conducted a multi-trophic study to assess ecosystem recovery following energy development for oil and gas extraction in northern U.S. Great Plains rangelands. We compared soil factors, plant species composition and cover, and nematode trophic structuring between reclaimed oil and gas well sites (""reclaims"") that comprise a chronosequence of two – 33 years since reclamation and adjacent, undeveloped rangeland at distances of 50 m and 150 m from reclaim edges. Soils and plant communities in reclaims did not match those on undeveloped rangeland even after 33 years. Reclaimed soils had higher salt concentrations and pH than undeveloped soils. Reclaims had lower overall plant cover, a greater proportion of exotic and ruderal plant cover and lower native plant species richness than undeveloped rangeland. However, nematode communities appear to have recovered following reclamation. Although total and omni-carnivorous nematode abundances differed between reclaimed well sites and undeveloped rangeland, community composition and structure did not. These findings suggest that current reclamation practices recover the functional composition of nematode communities, but not soil conditions or plant communities. Our results show that plant communities have failed to recover through reclamation: high soil salinity may create a persistent impediment to native plant growth and ecosystem recovery.</p>

"Data from: Deer keds and blacklegged ticks infesting ungulates in the United States: molecular detection of Bartonella spp., Rickettsia spp., Anaplasma spp., and Borrelia spp.","<p>Deer keds are blood-feeding flies from which several human and animal pathogens have been detected, including the causative agent of Lyme Disease (<em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>). Cervids, which are the primary hosts of deer keds, are not natural reservoirs of <em>B. burgdorferi</em>, and it has been suggested that deer keds may acquire bacterial pathogens by co-feeding near ticks that are infected with the bacteria. We tested this hypothesis by using a molecular assay to screen for presence of <em>Anaplasma</em> spp., <em>Bartonella</em> spp., <em>Borrelia</em> spp., and <em>Rickettsia</em> spp. in specimens of European deer keds (n=306) and blacklegged ticks (n=315) collected from 38 individual white-tailed deer in Pennsylvania. There was limited similarity in the bacterial DNA detected between these ectoparasites per host, suggesting that co-feeding may not be a mechanism by which deer keds acquire these bacteria. We discuss these results in relation to deer ked feeding biology, life history, and collection timepoints. In addition, we screened specimens of European deer keds (n=410), Neotropical deer keds (n=13), Western American deer keds (n=10), and Pacific deer keds (n=14) for these same bacterial pathogens.</p>

Data from: Defensive aphid symbiont Hamiltonella defensa effects on Aphelinus glycinis and Aphelinus atriplicis,"<p>Endosymbiont interactions with hosts have important effects on fitness, including the fitness of many pest and beneficial species. Among these interactions, facultative endosymbiotic bacteria can protect aphids from parasitoids. <em>Aphis craccivora</em> and <em>Acyrthosiphon pisum</em> can harbor the symbiotic bacteria <em>Hamiltonella defensa</em> and its bacteriophage APSE. Infection by <em>H. defensa</em> defends these aphids against some but not all parasitoid species in the hymenopteran family Braconidae. Here, we report results on the effect of <em>H. defensa</em> on parasitism of these aphids by species in the other major lineage of aphid parasitoids, <em>Aphelinus</em> species in the family Aphelinidae. Parasitism of aphids infected with <em>H. defensa</em> /APSE by two <em>Aphelinus</em> species did not differ from that of uninfected aphids. While <em>Aphelinus atriplicis</em> showed no difference in fitness components between infected and uninfected aphids, <em>Aphelinus glycinis</em> actually produced more adult progeny and larger female progeny on infected than on uninfected aphids. <em>Aphelinus glycinis</em> may increase host quality for itself by changing the titer of nutritional versus protective bacteria in such a way that aphids infected with <em>H. defensa</em> can be made more suitable for parasitoid development than uninfected aphids. Our results and reasoning suggest that these Aphelinus species may be less prone to harm by <em>H. defensa</em> /APSE that affect eggs because they have anhydropic, heavily chorionated eggs, which may not absorb toxins during embryogenesis.</p>

Data from: Demographic parameters shift over time among artificially selected Drosophila melanogaster: a case for or against lifetime reproductive measurements,"<p><em>Drosophila melanogaster</em> is a fruit fly pest found around the world. This insect responds plastically to variation in temperature and has been known to be locally adapted to different locations across the globe, with varying maximum and minimum thermal limits. Artificial selection can be used to create adaptive responses in a laboratory setting, which can be used to mimic a range of thermal responses. Previous research has shown that within 30 generations of selection, naturally caught <em>D. melanogaster</em> from North Carolina, USA, can produce populations with both increased and decreased responses to cold stress as demonstrated by the chill-coma recovery trait (Gerken et al. 2016). This dataset expands on cross-tolerances to reproductive capacity and includes data from the four artificially selected <em>D. melanogaster</em> populations and two control populations. Egg production and total lifespan were measured in a laboratory setting at five different temperatures. Two data resources are included: full egg production and longevity for each fly assayed. This study was used to establish how selection for cold tolerance can affect reproductive capacity and longevity.</p>

Data from: Development and Validation of KASP Markers for Wheat Streak Mosaic Virus Resistance Gene Wsm2,"<p>Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) can cause significant yield loss in wheat (<em>Triticum aestivum</em> L.) in the Great Plains of North America. A recently identified WSMV resistance gene, <em>Wsm2</em>, was mapped to chromosome 3BS in germplasm line 'CO960293–2'. Effective genetic markers tightly linked to the gene will enhance the selection of WSMV-resistant lines through marker-assisted selection. We have mapped Wsm2 using a high-density map developed from the wheat 90K Infinium iSelect single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array with recombinant inbred lines from the cross between CO960293–2 and susceptible cultivar 'TAM 111'. Array-based SNPs that mapped within 4 cM of <em>Wsm2</em> on chromosome 3BS were converted to Kompetitive Allele Specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (KASP) assays in this study. Six KASP SNPs were validated in two doubled haploid populations developed from crosses of 'RonL' × 'Ripper' and 'Snowmass' × 'Antero'. RonL and Snowmass possess the <em>Wsm2</em> gene from CO960293–2. Three closely linked KASP SNPs, converted from IAAV6442, BS00018764_51, and wsnp_Ra_c16264_24873670, showed high sensitivity and specificity (0.83 ≤ sensitivity ≤ 0.97, 0.89 ≤ specificity ≤ 0.99). The latter two were also validated in six F2 breeding populations. These three KASP SNPs were effective in differentiating resistant and susceptible genotypes. Comparative mapping was performed using sequences of SNPs flanking <em>Wsm2</em> and identified candidate genes and regions in <em>Brachypodium</em> and rice (<em>Oryza sativa</em> L. ssp. <em>japonica</em>). The KASP SNPs developed in this study should be useful for marker-assisted selection of <em>Wsm2</em> in wheat breeding programs, and the newly constructed map will also facilitate map based cloning of <em>Wsm2</em>.</p>

Data from: Discovery of MicroRNAs of the Stable Fly (Diptera: Muscidae) by High-Throughput Sequencing,"<p>This dataset reports discovery and initial comparative analysis of 88 presumptive microRNA (miRNA) sequences from the stable fly, obtained using high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs. The majority of stable fly miRNAs were 22-23 nucleotides (nt) in length. Many miRNAs were arthropod specific, and several mature miRNA sequences showed greater sequence identity to miRNAs from other blood-feeding dipterans such as mosquitoes rather than to Drosophilids. This initial step in characterizing the stable fly microRNAome provides a basis for further analyses of life stage-specific and tissue-specific expression to elucidate their functional roles in stable fly biology.</p>
<p>The stable fly, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.), is a serious ectoparasite affecting animal production and health of both animals and humans. Stable fly control relies largely on chemical insecticides; however, the development of insecticide resistance as well as environmental considerations requires continued discovery research to develop novel control technologies. MicroRNAs are a class of short noncoding RNAs that have been shown to be important regulators of gene expression across a wide variety of organisms, and may provide an innovative approach with regard to development of safer more targeted control technologies.</p>

Data from: Disruption of semiochemical-mediated movement by the immature Trogoderma variabile Baillon and Trogoderma inclusum Le Conte (Coleoptera: Dermestidae) after exposure to long-lasting insecticide netting,"<p>Four to six-week-old larvae of Trogoderma variabile and Trogoderma inclusum were used for the experiment. Both strains were originally obtained from the field in north-central Kansas in 2016 and 2012, respectively. Colonies of these species were reared under controlled conditions in an environmental chamber set to a temperature of 27.5 °C, 65% RH, and 14:10 (L:D) h photoperiod. Both species were fed 300 g of ground dog food (SmartBlend, Lamb flavor, PurinaOne, St. Louis, MO, USA) with oats sprinkled on top and a moistened, crumpled paper towel placed on the surface in a 950-ml mason jar.</p>
<p>Treatments<br />
The long-lasting insecticide-incorporated polyethylene netting (2 × 2 mm mesh, D-Terrance, Vestergaard Inc., Lausanne, Switzerland) included 0.4% deltamethrin, or control netting that was identical in physical properties but without insecticide. These were used with the movement assay. We assessed the movement in the vicinity of important pheromonal and food kairomones after exposure to LLIN or control netting. Food consisted of 0.01 g of organic, unbleached flour (Heartland Mills, Marienthal, KS, USA), and pheromonal stimuli included a broad spectrum, multi-species lure (PTL lure, IL-108-10, Batch#1288200321, Insects Limited, Westfield, IN, USA), including Trogoderma spp pheromone (Ranabhat et al. 2023a). In each replicate, we used a single pellet (white color), and affixed it in place so it did not move in a Petri dish using a 1 × 1 mm square of parafilm. For each replication of testing, we used a fresh lure.</p>
<p>Movement Assay<br />
The movement of larvae after exposure to the 0.4 % deltamethrin LLIN or a control netting in response to food cues (using 0.01 g of flour) or with conspecific sex pheromones (using a single bead from a disaggregated PTL lure held in place with a small square of parafilm), was tracked in six individual arenas (100 × 15 mm D: H) with a piece of filter paper (85 mm D, Ahlstrom-Munksjö, Helsinki, Finland) lining the bottom for 30 min using a network camera (GigE, Basler AG, Ahrenburg, Germany) affixed 76 cm above and centered over the dishes. The Petri dishes were backlit using a LED light box (42 × 30 cm W:L LPB3, Litup, Shenzhen, China) to increase contrast and affixed in place with white foam board. The video was streamed to a computer and processed in Ethovision (v.14.5 Noldus Inc., Leesburg, VA, USA). Prior to use in the movement assay, larvae of T. variabile  or T. inclusum were exposed to the 0.4% deltamethrin LLIN or a control netting for 1 min in a 21 × 21 cm square Petri dish, then their movement was tracked individually after a post-exposure holding duration of 1 min or 24 h. A small 1.1 cm hidden stimulus zone encircled each stimulus, midway and centered on each half of the arena wherein movement was tracked separately from each half of the arena (control vs. treatment). The total distance moved (cm), instantaneous velocity (cm/s), frequency of entering each half of the petri dish and stimulus zone, cumulative duration spent in each zone (s), and latency of entering each zone (s) over a 30 min trial period was logged after exposure to a given treatment. The control side of the arena remained empty. A total of n = 16 replicates were run per treatment combination for both species</p>
<p>No-Choice Release-Recapture Assay<br />
A release- recapture experiment was conducted for the larvae of both T. variabile and T. inclusum where larvae were exposed to the 0.4% deltamethrin LLIN and control netting for 1 min. After exposure, treated insects were released at one corner of the sanded plastic bin (60 × 41.6 × 16.5 cm L:W:H ). A commercial pitfall trap (Dome Trap™, Trécé, Inc., Adair, OK, USA) that contained a PTL lure (used only white beads as above), or 0.01 g flour, or no stimuli (unbaited for control), was deployed in the opposite corner, diagonally across from the release point in the bin. The bins were located in a large (4.8 × 2.1 × 6 m, L:W:H) walk-in environmental chamber (Percival Instruments, Dallas County, IA, USA) set at constant conditions (27.5°C, 60% RH, and 14:10 L:D). A total of 10 larvae were released in each bin during each replicate. Treated larvae were given 24 h to disperse to the semiochemicals in each trap, and then the number of insects captured inside the trap, found on the bottom of the trap, on the stimulus half of container or on the non-stimulus half of the container were recorded. A total of n = 12 replicates were performed per treatment combination for the larvae of each species.</p>

Red flour beetles will lay eggs in many types of flours but their choice to infest low- and no-gluten flours remains to be tested.

We find that the beetles lay similar amounts of eggs in buckwheat, teff, millet, rice, and rye flours but that they show significant declines in preference for sorghum, potato, quinoa, cassava, oat, amaranth, garbanzo, spelt, and corn flours. By using three different assays - a wind tunnel, a large arena, and a small arena - we can further parse out differences in whether volatiles or texture of the flour may play a bigger role in choosing these flours to lay their eggs. The number of eggs laid in each of these 14 flours, plus a wheat control, is reported for both the large and small arenas and preference or movement toward the flour source is reported for a wind tunnel assay.</p>

Hazardous Materials 2021, Vol. 408, 124405. Dataset may be assessed via the included link at the Dryad data repository.<br />
We assessed the enzymatic activation of four different biochars produced from pyrolyzing swine manure and poultry litter, and by co-pyrolyzing these livestock residues with agricultural spent mulch plastic film wastes (plastichars). Enzymatic activation consisted of incubating biochars in soil inoculated with earthworms (<em>Lumbricus terrestris</em>), which acted as biological vectors to facilitate retention of extracellular enzymes onto biochar surface. The activity of carboxylesterase ‒a pesticide-detoxifying enzyme‒ was measured in non-bioturbed soils (reference), linings of the burrows created by earthworms, casts (feces) and biochar particles recovered from the soil.<br />

Participants included 943 American adults who were aged 18-74 years (M = 37.51, SD = 9.50) and were recruited from across the United States through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). As a manipulation check we assessed whether participants accurately completed the manipulation by ensuring their response to the question of who made the flyer. Participants who answered the question incorrectly were excluded from the analysis.  In total, 537 answered correctly and were included in the analyses (Control = 113, Hospital = 144, Social Media = 121, USDA = 159). The majority of our eligible sample identified as men (N = 350), while the remainder identified as women (N = 185), nonbinary (N = 1), or “other” (N = 1).Participants completed an online survey in which they viewed one flyer containing dietary information and guidance on consuming pulses. The purported source of the flyer information was manipulated to create the 4 conditions. Participants rated the flyer in terms of perceived accuracy, trustworthiness, reliability, desirability for learning more from the source, and likelihood of following the advice. Attitudes, perceived control and norms, and past behavior were used to measure components of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). ANOVA results indicated that the USDA and hospital sources were perceived as more accurate, trustworthy, reliable, and more desirable to learn more from relative to control and social media. There were no differences in likelihood of following guidance depending on source. Multiple regression showed that measures of the TPB were predictors of likelihood of following advice. Participants also ranked their top 3 most trusted sources for health information from a list of 29 sources. Doctors, scientists, nurses, and family and friends were among the most frequently trusted sources. Overall, these findings suggest that trust in the source of information does not influence perceived likelihood of following dietary recommendations for pulses.</p>

Data from: Effect of cutting management on the forage production and quality of tepary bean,"<p>Data of the biomass production and forage quality (nutritive value) of 13 different tepary bean genotypes managed at four different cutting heights and three different cutting dates. The data was collected during 2020 and 2021 to compare cutting management of tepary bean with forage soybean.<br />
The study occurred at the Oklahoma and Central Plains Agricultural Research Center, El Reno, OK (35◦ 34’ N; 98◦ 2’ W, 414 m a.s.l.). Total rainfall was 340 mm in 2019 and 271 mm in 2020. No supplemental irrigation was applied. Weedy grasses were controlled with Clethodim 2EC throughout the growing season at a rate of 231.5 g a.i. ha-1).<br />
The study began June 10th 2020 and lasted 90 days. The study was replicated June 10th 2021 and lasted 90 days.<br />
Biomass was harvested from 0.5 m row lengths at 30-, 45-, or 90-day (end of season) intervals and at heights of 5, 10, or 15 cm above ground level to determine biomass production and regrowth ability. The 90-day interval was cut at 5 cm only and served as a control.<br />
Subsampling occurred 3 times for the 30 day, 2 times for the 45 day, and once for the 90 day. The 3–30-day samplings were summed to compare to the 90-day cutting. Likewise, the 2–45-day samplings were summed to compare to the 90-day cutting.<br />
Fresh weight of biomass was determined for clipped biomass, samples were dried at 60 ◦C for 72 hr, re-weighed to define dry matter, and subsequently ground to a 2.0 mm particle size for laboratory analysis using a Thomas Scientific Wiley Mill (Swedesboro, NJ, USA). The ground particles were thoroughly mixed and ~50g were scanned with a benchtop NIR (Unity Scientific Spectra Star XT with UCal calibration software, Westborough, MA, USA), and measures of forage quality [acid detergent fiber (ADF), in vitro True Digestibility (IVTD), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), total nitrogen content (N), total digestible nutrients (TDN), and a TDN:CP ratio] were evaluated. The benchtop NIR was validated with wet chemistry each year using approximately 10% of the samples. Occasionally, due to reduced plant growth, replications were combined to determine the forage quality of a genotype.<br />
Collected biomass (gm-2) was converted to Mgha-1). Data were analyzed with the Proc GLIMMIX procedure in SAS Studio 3.8. Genotype, cutting management (cutting height and cutting interval), and their interactions were considered fixed effects while the intercept of the linear predictor was considered a random effect with year as the subject (level).<br />
During the 90-day period from June to September, some genotypes of tepary bean provided greater amounts of biomass and forage quality than Laredo (forage soybean). The optimal management regime for tepary bean for forage was noted for one end of season (90-day) harvest as this was the best combination of biomass accumulation and forage nutritive value (forage quality).<br />
Breeding efforts to improve the forage characteristics and agronomic performance of tepary bean are required. Studies to determine the optimal planting rate/density are needed to refine and expand the use of tepary bean as an alternative forage.</p>

Data from: Effects of solar energy development on ants in the Mojave Desert,"<p>Data files for manuscript titled ""Effects of solar energy development on ants in the Mojave Desert"".</p>
<p>Excel file with 4 tabs: Metadata; Abundance, Richness, Shannon; Community Composition; and Functional Traits. Metadata is contained within Excel file that describes all variables for each tab.</p>
<p>Abstract from paper:<br />
Land-use change from solar energy development may affect desert ecosystems and the soils, plants, and animals therein, yet our understanding of these interactions is nascent. With their ubiquity, criticality as ecosystem constituents, and sensitivity to environmental variation, ants may be useful study organisms for elucidating ecological effects of solar energy development in deserts. Our objectives were to disentangle the response of a desert ant community to solar energy development decisions and test the efficacy of ants as bioindicators at Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System (ISEGS, 392 MW) in the Mojave Desert, USA. We used pitfall traps to collect ants in treatments representing different solar energy development decisions, including variably intense site preparation practices: blading (i.e., bulldozing) and mowing, and establishment of undeveloped patches in solar fields replicated across three power blocks comprising ISEGS and in undeveloped control sites surrounding ISEGS. We determined that ant abundance, species richness, Shannon Diversity Index, and functional richness was lower in bladed treatments than in all other treatments and controls. For most taxonomic and functional ant responses, we detected no difference between non-bladed treatments and controls; these results suggest that less intensive site preparation and increased spatial heterogeneity (i.e., undeveloped patches in solar fields) reduce negative effects of solar energy development on desert ants. However, our results suggest that ants may serve as useful bioindicators of the severity of anthropogenic disturbance from solar energy development in deserts, and indicator analysis signifies that solar energy infrastructure may negatively affect some species with high ecological value (e.g., harvester ants). Negative effects of solar energy development on ants can have significant implications for desert ecosystem function and integrity, but conservation-minded solar facility design and construction may lead to avoidance of “bottom-up” ecological ramifications of increased solar production during the renewable energy transition.</p>

Data from: Efficacy of deltamethrin and pirimiphos-methyl in layer-treated maize against the larger grain borer and the maize weevil,"<p>Two grain surface treatment insecticides (deltamethrin and pirimiphos-methyl were evaluated in laboratory assays as a surface treatment for maize to control adult Prostephanus truncatus and Sitophilus zeamais. Both insecticides were applied to 20 g of maize placed in a vial or to the upper one half, one fourth, or one-eighth layer of the maize. Insects were either added to the vials before or after the maize. Mortality, progeny production, and insect damaged kernels (IDK) were then evaluated for each vial. Introduction method (before or after) did not have any impact on any of the variables. Mortality was nearly 100% for all treatments for both insecticides for P. truncatus. Subsequently, progeny production and the number of insect damaged kernels was very low or zero for P. truncatus. Mortality for S. zeamais remained low across layer treatments for deltamethrin. However, S. zeamais was easily controlled by primiphos-methyl. The results of this laboratory study show that while deltamethrin and pirimiphos-methyl has some effectiveness as a layer treatment on a column of maize, efficacy will be dependent on the target species, and the depth of the treated layer, as well as the location on which the insects are present.</p>

<li><strong>Resource Title:</strong> Grain Layer Experiment with P. truncatus & Sitophilus zeamais<br />
<strong>File Name:</strong> quellhorst_etal_layer_experiment.csv<br />
<strong>Description:</strong> Insect Mortality on Treated Maize and Progeny Production. For each replicate, 500 g of maize were treated with each insecticide or H2O (e.g., control) as described above. Before proceeding with the experiments, the grain moisture content (m.c.) was assessed, using a moisture meter (mini GAC plus, Dickey-John Europe S.A.S., Colombes, France). The standard plastic cylindrical vials of the Laboratory of Entomology and Agricultural Zoology (LEAZ) were used (3 × 8 cm in diameter by height, Rotilabo Sample tins Snap on lid, Carl Roth, Germany). These were filled with 20g of maize. In each vial, we treated either all the grain (1/1), 1/2, 1/4 or 1/8 of the maize with one of the two insecticides (deltamethrin or pirimiphos-methyl) at the labeled rate. We also either placed the insects at the bottom of the vial (before the maize has been added) or at the top (after the maize has been added). Sets A, B, and C were treated with insecticide on separate days. Insects were given 14 days before mortality counts were performed. After this interval, the mortality was assessed. It is difficult to estimate the upper 1/8 etc. of maize, therefore we based our experiments on ratios of 20 g treated, 20 g untreated, 10 g treated with 10 g untreated, 5 g treated with 15 g untreated and 2 g treated with 18 g untreated. The exact quantities of the samples were weighed with a Precisa XB3200D compact balance (Alpha Analytical Instruments, Gerakas, Greece). The upper rings of the vials were treated with Fluon (Northern Products Inc., Woonsocket, USA) to prevent insects from moving away from the grain and or escaping. The top of each vial also had small holes punched to allow ventilation. Each vial then received 10 P. truncatus adults of mixed sex and age from the Tanzania strain or 10 S. zeamais from Brazil. The vials were placed inside incubators set at 30°C and 65% R.H. After the parental mortality count, all adults were removed, and the vials with maize were returned to the incubator at the conditions indicated above. Sixty days later, the vials were opened again to check progeny production and the number of insect damaged kernels (IDK).<br />
For each combination, e.g., insecticide × insect species, there were three replicates with three subreplicates (total 3 × 3 = 9 vials or replicates per combination). There were 2 insecticides × 2 insect species × 4 grain treatments (1/1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8) × 2 insect introduction methods (before or after) × 9 replicates/subreplicates = 288 vials total, 5760 g of maize, 10 insects per vial × 288 = 2880 total (1440 per LAGB and MW). We also had a separate set of vials for the control with no insecticide= 9 × 2 insect species = 18 vials, 360 g of maize, and 180 insects (90 per species).</li>

Data from: Efficient imaging and computer vision detection of two cell shapes in young cotton fibers,"<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>
<p>Cotton plants were grown in a well-controlled greenhouse in the NC State Phytotron as described previously (Pierce et al, 2019). Flowers were tagged on the day of anthesis and harvested three days post anthesis (3 DPA). The distinct fiber shapes had already formed by 2 DPA (Stiff and Haigler, 2016; Graham and Haigler, 2021), and fibers were still relatively short at 3 DPA, which facilitated the visualization of multiple fiber tips in one image.</p>
<p>Cotton fiber sample preparation, digital image collection, and image analysis:</p>
<p>Ovules with attached fiber were fixed in the greenhouse. The fixative previously used (Histochoice) (Stiff and Haigler, 2016; Pierce et al., 2019; Graham and Haigler, 2021) is obsolete, which led to testing and validation of another low-toxicity, formalin-free fixative (#A5472; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; Fig. S1). The boll wall was removed without damaging the ovules. (Using a razor blade, cut away the top 3 mm of the boll. Make about 1 mm deep longitudinal incisions between the locule walls, and finally cut around the base of the boll.) All of the ovules with attached fiber were lifted out of the locules and fixed (1 h, RT, 1:10 tissue:fixative ratio) prior to optional storage at 4°C. Immediately before imaging, ovules were examined under a stereo microscope (incident light, black background, 31X) to select three vigorous ovules from each boll while avoiding drying. Ovules were rinsed (3 x 5 min) in buffer [0.05 M PIPES, 12 mM EGTA. 5 mM EDTA and 0.1% (w/v) Tween 80, pH 6.8], which had lower osmolarity than a microtubule-stabilizing buffer used previously for aldehyde-fixed fibers (Seagull, 1990; Graham and Haigler, 2021). While steadying an ovule with forceps, one to three small pieces of its chalazal end with attached fibers were dissected away using a small knife (#10055-12; Fine Science Tools, Foster City, CA). Each ovule piece was placed in a single well of a 24-well slide (#63430-04; Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) containing a single drop of buffer prior to applying and sealing a 24 x 60 mm coverslip with vaseline.</p>
<p>Samples were imaged with brightfield optics and default settings for the 2.83 mega-pixel,  color, CCD camera of the Keyence BZ-X810 imaging system (<a href=""http://www.keyence.com;"">www.keyence.com;</a> housed in the Cellular and Molecular Imaging Facility of NC State). The location of each sample in the 24-well slides was identified visually using a 2X objective and mapped using the navigation function of the integrated Keyence software. Using the 10X objective lens (plan-apochromatic; NA 0.45) and 60% closed condenser aperture setting, a region with many fiber apices was selected for imaging using the multi-point and z-stack capture functions. The precise location was recorded by the software prior to visual setting of the limits of the z-plane range (1.2 µm step size). Typically, three 24-sample slides (representing three accessions) were set up in parallel prior to automatic image capture. The captured z-stacks for each sample were processed into one two-dimensional image using the full-focus function of the software. (Occasional samples contained too much debris for computer vision to be effective, and these were reimaged.)</p>

Data from: Evaluating plant biodiversity measurements and exotic species detection in National Resources Inventory Sampling protocols using examples from the Northern Great Plains of the USA,"<p>Plant biodiversity data and associated soils, ecological site, and livestock management data that were collected at the USDA-ARS Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory in 2011 and 2013. Data were collected using the modified Whittaker technique. The unique design of the Whitaker method reduces autocorrelation among subplots, which is common in standard transect methods (Goslee, 2006). Grassland scientists worldwide use this standard technique to quantify and monitor plant diversity on, for example, Serengeti grasslands (Anderson et al., 2006), South African serpentine grasslands (Reddy et al., 2009), and rangelands in Turkey (Firinciglu et al., 2007) among many other environments. In addition, Sanderson at the NGPRL and Goslee at ARS University Park have developed a large database on plant species diversity of grazing lands in the U.S. (nearly 300 sites sampled using the Whitaker plot method). The use of the standardized Whitaker plot method allows us to combine data from the northern Great Plains with other databases worldwide for larger-scale meta-analyses. The multiscale technique also enables comparison of vegetation dynamics at multiple scales.</p>

Grassland scientists worldwide use this standard technique to quantify and monitor plant diversity on, for example, Serengeti grasslands (Anderson et al., 2006), South African serpentine grasslands (Reddy et al., 2009), and rangelands in Turkey (Firinciglu et al., 2007) among many other environments. In addition, Sanderson at the NGPRL and Goslee at ARS University Park have developed a large database on plant species diversity of grazing lands in the U.S. (nearly 300 sites sampled using the Whitaker plot method). The use of the standardized Whitaker plot method allows us to combine data from the northern Great Plains with other databases worldwide for larger-scale meta-analyses. The multiscale technique also enables comparison of vegetation dynamics at multiple scales.</p>

Data from: Evidence for polyphosphate accumulating organism (PAO)-mediated phosphorus cycling in stream biofilms under alternating aerobic/anaerobic conditions,"<p>Phosphorus availability often limits primary production in freshwater ecosystems and excessive P inputs promote accelerated eutrophication. Microbial mechanisms may control O2-dependent uptake/release of P in stream sediments and biofilms, but specific organisms responsible for these cycles have not been identified. Polyphosphate Accumulating Organisms (PAOs) are purposely enriched in treatment plants to remove P from wastewater. PAOs release P under anaerobic conditions and take it up under aerobic conditions. It is hypothesized that alternating aerobic/anaerobic conditions promote patterns of P uptake/release similar to those attributed to PAOs in wastewater treatment. Intact, native stream biofilms were collected in the Cascadilla Creek Watershed in Tompkins County, New York, and subjected to laboratory treatments to impose conditions similar to what may occur because of diel oxygenic and respiratory cycles: 1) continuous sparging with air and 2) alternate sparging with air or anaerobic gas (20∶80% by volume CO2∶N2).  PO43−, Ca, Mg, total Mn, K, Fe2+, and total S (TS) concentrations in the water were monitored and total P (TP) and polyphosphate (polyP) concentrations in the biofilms at the start and end of the experiment. Microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to quantify the percentage of cells with stored intracellular polyP and to test for known PAO genes, respectively.</p>

Data from: Evolution of male courtship behavior among species of parasitoids in the genus Aphelinus (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae),"<p>We compared male courtship behavior among parasitoid species in the genus <em>Aphelinus</em>. Male <em>Aphelinus</em> antennate in alternating bouts of waving and simultaneous dipping. Among species, durations of courtship rounds varied, and within these rounds, durations of dipping and waving bouts varied. Furthermore, number of dipping bouts, dips per bout, and positions of male antennae during courtship varied among species. Logistic regression of species on these components of male behavior correctly classified males to species with 95 percent accuracy. Mapping these courtship components onto a molecular phylogeny showed that antennal positions tended to be phylogenetically conserved, whereas antennation durations and numbers of bouts diverged when clades diverged. The overall phylogenetic signal was weak. Comparison of behavioral components between allopatric and sympatric species, controlling for phylogenetic distance, showed little evidence for reinforcement in sympatry.</p>
<p>Data are presented on parasitoid and host aphid species sampling locations, courtship behavior, and geographical patristic distance.</p>

"Data from: Exercise plasma metabolomics and xenometabolomics in obese, sedentary, insulin-resistant women: impact of a fitness and weight loss intervention","<p>Insulin resistance has wide-ranging effects on metabolism but there are knowledge gaps regarding the tissue origins of systemic metabolite patterns, and how patterns are altered by fitness and metabolic health. To address these questions, plasma metabolite patterns were determined every 5 min during exercise (30 min, ~45% of V̇O2peak, ~63 W) and recovery in overnight-fasted sedentary, obese, insulin resistant women under controlled conditions of diet and physical activity. We hypothesized that improved fitness and insulin sensitivity following a ~14 wk training and weight loss intervention would lead to fixed workload plasma metabolomics signatures reflective of metabolic health and muscle metabolism.  Pattern analysis over the first 15 min of exercise—regardless of pre- vs. post-intervention status—highlighted anticipated increases in fatty acid tissue uptake and oxidation (e.g., reduced long-chain fatty acids), diminution of non-oxidative fates of glucose (e.g., lowered sorbitol-pathway metabolites and glycerol-3-galactoside [possible glycerolipid synthesis metabolite]), and enhanced tissue amino acid use (e.g., drops in amino acids; modest increase in urea). A novel observation was that exercise significantly increased several xenometabolites (“non-self” molecules, from microbes or foods), including benzoic acid/salicylic acid/salicylaldehyde, hexadecanol/octadecanol/dodecanol, and chlorogenic acid.  In addition, many non-annotated metabolites changed with exercise. Although exercise itself strongly impacted the global metabolome, there were surprisingly few intervention-associated differences despite marked improvements in insulin sensitivity, fitness, and adiposity. These results, and previously-reported plasma acylcarnitine profiles, support the principle that most metabolic changes during sub-maximal aerobic exercise are closely tethered to absolute ATP turnover rate (workload), regardless of fitness or metabolic health status.</p>
<p>Supporting Materials include graphs of blood patterns of metabolites in adult women during a sub-maximal exercise bout and recovery period, and primary data in spreadsheet format on model performance, exercise and recovery, and correlation statistics for metabolites.</p>

Data from: Exotic herbivores and fire energy drive standing herbaceous biomass but do not alter compositional patterns in a semiarid savanna ecosystem,"<p>The data comprise 2 years of biomass and plant community data from a study on fire and herbivore impacts on vegetation in semi-arid Texas savanna. Data are from 72 10m x 10m plots. We randomly assigned one of three fire treatments (no fire, low-energy fire, and high-energy fire), to each whole plot, resulting in 24 replicates. We then divided each of the seventy-two whole plots into four quadrants and established a subplot in the middle of each quadrant. We randomly assigned one of two herbivory treatments to two subplots within each whole plot, with an herbivore exclusion cage (hereafter exclosure) randomly assigned to two subplots; the remaining two subplots served as controls (herbivore-accessible with no exclosure; hereafter herbivore-accessible). We constructed exclosures from 0.13 x 0.76m 19-gauge steel hardware cloth encircled into a 0.5m diameter cage. We secured them with wires to ensure there were no gaps and securely anchored them to be flush with the soil surface. Similar hardware cloth roofs were constructed and affixed on the top of the exclosures to ensure exclusion of vertebrate herbivores. The herbivore-accessible controls were equivalent diameter subplots without an exclosure.</p>
<p>During the growing season one year after treatment implementation (April 2019) we selected one exclosure and one herbivore-accessible subplot for above-ground biomass harvesting. We removed exclosures and hand-clipped all vegetation in the plot to soil level, separated it by functional group, placed it in paper bags, and dried it at 60 degrees C for 24hrs prior to weighing. We clipped herbivore-accessible subplots in the same manner using a 0.5m diameter circular wire-frame to mimic the caged area in adjacent subplots. This process was repeated in August 2020 on the two remaining unharvested subplots. Before clipping, for each subplot, we visually assessed the percent cover of each species present following the Daubenmire classification system.</p>

Data from: Experiments on Jackson trap efficiency capturing Bactrocera dorsalis and Zeugodacus cucurbitae,"<p>Jackson traps baited with male lures with or without insecticides are essential components of surveillance and monitoring programs against pest tephritid fruit flies. The ability of a trap to capture a fly that enters, sometimes termed “trap efficiency”, is dependent on many factors including the trap/lure/toxicant combination. We tested the effects of three important components of Jackson traps on efficiency of capture of two important fruit fly species, using the “standard” (i.e., as they are used in the state-wide surveillance program in California) and alternatives: Insecticide (Naled, DDVP or None), type of adhesive on the sticky panel (Seabright Laboratories Stickem Special Regular or Stickem Special HiTack), and use of a single or combination male lure (Methyl eugenol and/or cuelure). Experiments were conducted in large outdoor carousel olfactometers with known numbers of <em>Bactrocera dorsalis</em> and <em>Zeugodacus cucurbitae</em> and by trapping wild populations of the same two species. Lures were aged out to eight weeks to develop a comprehensive dataset on trap efficiency of the various combinations.</p>

Data from: Field Trapping and Flight Capacity of Eucosma giganteana (Riley) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in Response to Behaviorally Active Congeneric Semiochemicals in Novel Silflower Agroecosystems,"<p>We evaluated the flight behavior of <em>E. giganteana</em> in response to semiochemicals identified from other closely related <em>Eucosma</em> species, including: (Z)- and (E)-8-dodecenyl acetate, (E)-9-dodecenyl acetate, (Z)-8-dodecenol, (E,E)-8,10-dodecadienyl acetate, and (Z,E)-9,12-tetradecadienyl acetate. The goals of this study were to evaluate whether any of these compounds could improve capture of <em>E. giganteana</em> on clear sticky cards in the field, and whether the most attractive volatiles might affect flight behavior on a computer-automated flight mill assay. We found that there was significant attraction to (E)-8-dodecenyl acetate in two years in the field, which may possibly be a component in the pheromone blend for <em>E. giganteana</em>. On flight mills, <em>E. giganteana</em> flew an average of 23 km in a 24 h period. The presence of attractive stimuli (e.g., (E)-8-dodecenyl acetate) had arresting properties and decreasing flight distance on the mill by 78 to 80%. The longest flight distances were registered in the morning (4:00–12:00) and were 1.8-fold greater than flight distances and durations at night (20:00–4:00). (E)-8-dodecenyl acetate may be useful in behaviorally based monitoring and management strategies for <em>E. giganteana</em>. Overall, our research expands the knowledge on the chemical ecology of adult <em>E. giganteana</em>.</p>
<p>Dataset includes testing field-captured <em>E. giganteana</em> adults collected from UV light traps deployed at The Land Institute in Salina, KS, and hand-collected at night during the period of peak activity for <em>E. giganteana</em>. Two trials are included: a field baiting assay, and laboratory flight mill assay. In the field baiting assay, each field had three transects spaced at least 10 m apart, each with a full set of semiochemical treatments represented. Each trap within the transect was spaced 10 m apart. Each trap consisted of a 1.27-cm diameter PVC pipe hammered in row with the silflower to a finished height of 1 m, in line with the canopy of <em>Silphium integrifolium</em>. A single 30.4 cm × 30.4 cm clear sticky card (Alpha Scents, Canby, OR, USA) was folded in half and inserted in a 271 cm long sticky card ring holder (Olson Products Inc., Medina, OH, USA). The ring holder was bent at a 90° angle to wedge the card holder upright in position, which was subsequently wedged in the opening at the top of the PVC pipe. A single, capped LDPE 3-mL dropping bottle with one of the semiochemical treatments above was inserted in the top of the PCV pipe opening and affixed in place by tying it to the card holder with garden wire. Every week, the lures were replaced with a freshly prepared treatment and the position of the lure was rotated in the transect every two weeks. Traps were rotated because of the short duration of the flying season and resulted in every treatment occupying every position at least once. Sticky cards were changed on a weekly basis after the first recorded capture of an <em>E. giganteana</em> adult. Traps were deployed 7 June 2019 to 14 August 2019 and 15 June 2020 to 10 August 2020. In total, there were n = 3 replicates of each semiochemical treatment per field site. The number of <em>E. giganteana</em> and Lepidopteran nontargets was counted on each sticky card after freezing cards at −20 °C for at least 24 h.</p>
<p>For the flight mill assay, six adults were run simultaneously on the six flight mills described in the associated article (15-FMASM SDP Unit, Crist Instrument Co., Hagerstown, MD, USA) to test flight capacity. Each trial was started between 15:00 and 18:00 by gently blowing on the insect to initiate flight and run for 24 h in parallel. Assays were conducted at 21.4 ± 0.01 °C temperature and 54.2 ± 0.2% RH and monitored with a datalogger (UX100-011, Hobo, temp/RH logger, Onset, Bourne, MA, USA). The semiochemical treatments in the flight mill assay included (E)-8-dodecenyl acetate, (Z)-9-dodecenyl acetate, and an unbaited control (acetone solvent only). Semiochemicals were freshly prepared in LDPE dropping bottles, as in the field-baiting experiment (as above), and placed in the center among the flight mills on a nonporous glass surface to prevent contamination. There were 12–18 replicates per treatment. At the end of a trial, insects were detached and weighed on a balance. Data were streamed in real time to a computer which automatically record the flight parameters: distance flown, the number of tandem flight bouts over the sampling interval (flights lasting more than 1 s), mean flight bout duration, and mean distance flown per bout. Data were also parsed by time of date to determine maximum time of dispersal. Data were analyzed with R software.</p>

Data from: First Report of Squash vein yellowing virus in Watermelon in Guatemala,"<p>Watermelon (<em>Citrullus lanatus</em>) and other cucurbits are important crops grown in Guatemala for local consumption and export. The whitefly (<em>Bemisia tabaci</em>) vector of <em>Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder virus</em> (CYSDV), <em>Melon chlorotic leaf curl virus</em> (MCLCuV), and <em>Squash vein yellowing virus</em> (SqVYV) was observed in fields with numbers increasing during the season. Four samplings of crowns, peduncles, and/or leaves of symptomatic plants were made in March and April 2015. Total RNA was extracted from symptomatic plant tissue and tested by RT-PCR for SqVYV, CYSDV, <em>Papaya ringspot virus</em> (PRSV), and/or begomoviruses. Primers specific for the coat protein gene of SqVYV (1020 bp), CYSDV (707 bp), or PRSV (511 bp), and degenerate begomovirus primers (1159 or 533 bp) amplified products of the expected sizes from 15 of 24, 20 of 24, 4 of 24, or 8 of 8 plants, respectively. SqVYV amplicons from six individual plants from the fourth sampling, SqVYV and CYSDV amplicons from a pool of plants from the third sampling, and degenerate begomovirus amplicons from the second sampling were cloned in the pGEM-T vector. Five clones of each amplicon were sequenced in both directions and representative consensus sequences were deposited in GenBank (Accession Nos. KT007178 to KT007183). Sequence analysis demonstrated that SqVYV coat protein gene sequences from Guatemala shared 99 to 100% nucleotide (nt) identity with each other, and 97 to 98% nt identity with divergent SqVYV isolates previously described from Florida (e.g., WM2005aHi, GenBank Accession No. JF897974) and California (GenBank Accession No. KP218061), but only 90% nt identity with the predominant SqVYV isolate found in Florida (e.g., Sq2003Hi, GenBank Accession No. EU259611) . Tissue blots were prepared from crowns and peduncles from the first, third, and fourth samplings, and tested by tissue blot nucleic acid hybridization assay for SqVYV. Tissue blots indicated SqVYV infection in an additional 48 of 102 watermelon samples, and cylindrical inclusions typical of SqVYV were observed in phloem tissue from the fourth sampling by light microscopy, confirming the identification of SqVYV. This is the first report of SqVYV infecting watermelon in Central America.</p>

Data from: Flight burst duration as an indicator of flight ability and physical fitness in two species of Tephritid fruit flies,"<p>These data are from a study on a new method to quantify flight ability and physical fitness of individual fruit flies which we term ‘Flight Burst Duration’ (FBD). The method consisted of tethering individual insects by the dorsal thorax using a vacuum and measuring the length of time the insect beats its wings while suspended off a surface. Consecutive measurements with <em>Bactrocera dorsalis</em> Hendel (Dipera: Tephritidae) and <em>Zeugodacus cucurbitae</em> Coquillett (Diptera: Tephritidae) in the same day and across days indicated that a single measurement was sufficient, and that FBD was consistent and repeatable. Insects under stress from starvation displayed shorter FBD over time, and we suggest that the measure also relates to the physical condition or survival fitness of the individual. Though somewhat laborious and timeconsuming, we proposed that FBD can be useful for research studies requiring individual-level phenome data and for obtaining estimates quality and dispersive movement for insects.</p>

Data from: Gene expression during the early stages of host perception and attachment in adult female Rhipicephalus microplus ticks,"<p>This study produced a comprehensive transcriptome from newly molted adult ticks and will provide a useful resource for studies of tick feeding and host perception and also assist genome annotation refinements.</p>
<p>The goal was to develop a comprehensive transcriptome of adult female Rhipicephalus microplus ticks and discover transcriptome changes that are related to feeding and host-perception prior to feeding. We have sequenced the transcriptomes of unfed newly molted adult female ticks, newly molted adult females that were feeding upon a bovine host for 3 hours following attachment to the host, and newly molted adult females that were placed in a gas-permeable bag attached to a bovine host for 3 hours (attachment to host prevented but host odors available to the ticks). There were 2 biological replicates and transcriptomes assembled from each individual experimental condition. A collective adult female transcriptome was assembled from sequence data pooled from all 3 conditions (using data from all replicates). Differential gene expression was examined using all possible comparisons to detect putative feeding-associated and host perception-associated transcripts.</p>

Data from: Genetic Diversity and Population Structure of the USDA Sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas) Germplasm Collections Using GBSpoly,"<p>Sweetpotato (<em>Ipomoea batatas</em>) plays a critical role in food security and is the most important root crop worldwide following potatoes and cassava. In the United States (US), it is valued at over $700 million USD. There are two sweetpotato germplasm collections (Plant Genetic Resources Conservation Unit and US Vegetable Laboratory) maintained by the USDA, ARS for sweetpotato crop improvement. To date, no genome-wide assessment of genetic diversity within these collections has been reported in the published literature. In our study, population structure and genetic diversity of 417 USDA sweetpotato accessions originating from 8 broad geographical regions (Africa, Australia, Caribbean, Central America, Far East, North America, Pacific Islands, and South America) were determined using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified with a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) protocol, GBSpoly, optimized for highly heterozygous and polyploid species. Population structure using Bayesian clustering analyses (STRUCTURE) with 32,784 segregating SNPs grouped the accessions into four genetic groups and indicated a high degree of mixed ancestry. A neighbor-joining cladogram and principal components analysis based on a pairwise genetic distance matrix of the accessions supported the population structure analysis. Pairwise FST values between broad geographical regions based on the origin of accessions ranged from 0.017 (Far East – Pacific Islands) to 0.110 (Australia – South America) and supported the clustering of accessions based on genetic distance. The markers developed for use with this collection of accessions provide an important genomic resource for the sweetpotato community, and contribute to our understanding of the genetic diversity present within the US sweetpotato collection and the species.</p>

Data from: Genome Sequence of the Thermotolerant Foodborne Pathogen Salmonella enterica Serovar Senftenberg ATCC 43845 and Phylogenetic Analysis of Loci Encoding Increased Protein Quality Control Mechanisms,"<p><em>Salmonella enterica</em> subsp. <em>enterica</em> bacteria are important foodborne pathogens with major economic impact. Some isolates exhibit increased heat tolerance, a concern for food safety. Analysis of a finished-quality genome sequence of an isolate commonly used in heat resistance studies, <em>S. enterica</em> subsp. <em>enterica</em> serovar Senftenberg 775W (ATCC 43845), demonstrated an interesting observation that this strain contains not just one, but two horizontally acquired thermotolerance locus homologs. These two loci reside on a large 341.3-kbp plasmid that is similar to the well-studied IncHI2 R478 plasmid but lacks any antibiotic resistance genes found on R478 or other IncHI2 plasmids. As this historical <em>Salmonella</em> isolate has been in use since 1941, comparative analysis of the plasmid and of the thermotolerance loci contained on the plasmid will provide insight into the evolution of heat resistance loci as well as acquisition of resistance determinants in IncHI2 plasmids.</p>

"Data from: Genome of the small hive beetle (Aethina tumida, Coleoptera: Nitidulidae), a worldwide parasite of social bee colonies, provides insights into detoxification and herbivory","<p>The small hive beetle (<em>Aethina tumida</em>, ATUMI) is an invasive parasite of bee colonies. ATUMI feeds on both fruits and bee nest products, facilitating its spread and increasing its impact on honey bees and other pollinators. The ATUMI genome has been sequenced and annotated, providing the first genomic resources for this species and for the Nitidulidae, a beetle family that is closely related to the extraordinarily species-rich clade of beetles known as the Phytophaga. ATUMI thus provides a contrasting view as a neighbor for one of the most successful known animal groups. A robust genome assembly and a gene set possessing 97.5% of the core proteins known from the holometabolous insects are presented. The ATUMI genome encodes fewer enzymes for plant digestion than the genomes of wood-feeding beetles, but nonetheless shows signs of broad metabolic plasticity. Gustatory receptors are few in number compared to other beetles, especially receptors with known sensitivity (in other beetles) to bitter substances. In contrast, several gene families implicated in detoxification of insecticides and adaptation to diverse dietary resources show increased copy numbers. The presence and diversity of homologs involved in detoxification differs substantially from the bee hosts of ATUMI. Results provide new insights into the genomic basis for local adaption and invasiveness in ATUMI, and a blueprint for control strategies that target this pest without harming their honey bee hosts. A minimal set of gustatory receptors is consistent with the observation that, once a host colony is invaded, food resources are predictable. Unique detoxification pathways and pathway members can help identify which treatments might control this species even in the presence of honey bees, which are notoriously sensitive to pesticides.</p>

Data from: Genome wide association study of thyroid hormone levels following challenge with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus,"<p>Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) causes respiratory disease in piglets and reproductive disease in sows. Piglet and fetal serum thyroid hormone (i.e., T3 and T4) levels decrease rapidly in response to PRRSV infection. However, the genetic control of T3 and T4 during infection is not completely understood. Our objective was to estimate genetic parameters and identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for absolute T3 and/or T4 levels of piglets and fetuses challenged with PRRSV. Sera from 5-week-old pigs (N=1792) at 11 days post inoculation (DPI) with PRRSV were assayed for T3 levels (piglet_T3). Sera from fetuses (N=1267) at 12 or 21 days post maternal inoculation (DPMI) with PRRSV of sows (N=145) in late gestation were assayed for T3 (fetal_T3) and T4 (fetal_T4) levels. Animals were genotyped using 60K Illumina or 650K Affymetrix SNP panels. Heritabilities, phenotypic correlations, and genetic correlations were estimated using ASREML; genome wide association studies were performed for each trait separately using JWAS. All three traits were low to moderately heritable (10 to 16%). Phenotypic and genetic correlations of piglet_T3 levels with weight gain (0-42 DPI) were 0.26±0.03 and 0.67±0.14, respectively. Nine significant QTL were identified for piglet_T3, on Sus scrofa chromosomes (SSC) 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 15, and 17, and collectively explaining 30% of the genetic variation (GV), with the largest QTL identified on SSC5, explaining 15% of the GV. Three significant QTL were identified for fetal_T3 on SSC1 and SSC4, which collectively explained 10% of the GV. Five significant QTL were identified for fetal_T4 on SSC1, 6, 10, 13, and 15, which collectively explained 14% of the GV. Several putative immune-related candidate genes were identified, including CD247, IRF8, and MAPK8. Thyroid hormone levels following PRRSV infection were heritable and had positive genetic correlations with growth rate. Multiple QTL with moderate effects were identified for T3 and T4 levels during challenge with PRRSV and candidate genes were identified, including several immune-related genes. These results advance our understanding of growth effects of both piglet and fetal response to PRRSV infection, revealing factors associated with genomic control of host resilience.</p>

A subset of 264 lines from the National Small Grains Collection global hexaploid winter wheat germplasm collection was evaluated under controlled growth chamber conditions for reaction to the pathogens <em>Parastagonospora nodorum</em> and <em>Pyrenophora tritici-repentis</em>.<br />
Both infiltrations and inoculations were performed on plants planted in plastic cones and when seedlings were at the second leaf stage. Plants were infiltrated with the <em>P. nodorum</em> necrotrophic effectors (NEs) SnTox1, SnToxA, SnTox3, SnTox267, and SnTox5; and the <em>P. tritici-repentis</em> NE Ptr ToxB. The scoring system was 0-3, with reaction types of 2 and 3 considered sensitive and 0 to 1 were insensitive.<br />
Plants were inoculated with the <em>P. nodorum</em> isolates Sn4, Sn2000, AR2-1, SnIr05H71a, and NOR4 and <em>P. tritici-repentis</em> isolates Pti2, 86-124, DW5, and AR CrossB10. After inoculation, plants were placed in a 100 % humidity growth chamber at 21 °C for 24 hours under constant light, then moved to a controlled growth chamber at 21 °C with a 12 h photoperiod. Plants were scored at 7 days post inoculation. For <em>P. nodorum</em>, plants were scored using a 0 to 5 scale, with 0 being highly resistant and 5 being highly susceptible. For <em>P. tritici-repentis</em>, plants were scored using a 1 to 5 scale, with 1 being highly resistance and 5 being highly susceptible.<br />
Three homogeneous replicates (determined by Bartlett’s chi squared analysis) were used to calculate an average value for each trait. This value was used for the rest of the analysis.</p>
<p>Genotypic Data<br />
DNA of the winter wheat panel was extracted and genotyped using the Illumina iSelect 90k wheat SNP array. Clustering data was analyzed using GenomeStudio 2.0.5 from Illumina, Inc. SNPs were ordered based on their physical position in the Chinese Spring IWGSC RefSeq v2.0. In TASSEL v5.2, SNP markers were filtered with a minor allele frequency greater than 0.01 and missing data less than 50%. For the remaining markers, missing values were imputed using the LD-KNNi method.</p>

Data from: Genomic divergence of zebu and taurine cattle identified through high-density SNP genotyping,"<p>The following is taken directly from the introduction of the paper.  In this study, we used a pure drift FST model [11] which assumes all animals originated from the same ancestral population. This model was applied to taurine and zebu animals to identify loci under selection. These two groups correspond to the main (and most ancestral) separation of domestic cattle, which in most but not all cases corresponds to animals adapted to tropical and temperate environments. The identification of such loci can aid in the identification of genes and genomic variants that are related to environmental adaptation and/or selection derived from human agro-pastoral activities.</p>

Data from: Genomic structural differences between cattle and River Buffalo identified through comparative genomic and transcriptomic analysis,"<p>Water buffalo (<em>Bubalus bubalis</em> L.) is an important livestock species worldwide. Like many other livestock species, water buffalo lacks high quality and continuous reference genome assembly, required for fine-scale comparative genomics studies. In this work, we present a dataset, which characterizes genomic differences between water buffalo genome and the extensively studied cattle (<em>Bos taurus</em> Taurus) reference genome. This data set is obtained after alignment of 14 river buffalo whole genome sequencing datasets to the cattle reference. This data set consisted of 13, 444 deletion CNV regions, and 11,050 merged mobile element insertion (MEI) events within the upstream regions of annotated cattle genes. Gene expression data from cattle and buffalo were also presented for genes impacted by these regions.</p>
<p>This study sought to characterize differences in gene content, regulation and structure between taurine cattle and river buffalo (2n=50) (one extant type of water buffalo) using the extensively annotated UMD3.1 cattle reference genome as a basis for comparisons. Using 14 WGS datasets from river buffalo, we identified 13,444 deletion CNV regions (Supplemental Table 1) in river buffalo, but not identified in cattle. We also presented 11,050 merged mobile element insertion (MEI) events (Supplemental Table 2) in river buffalo, out of which, 568 of them are within the upstream regions of annotated cattle genes. Furthermore, our tissue transcriptomics analysis provided expression profiles of genes impacted by MEI (Supplemental Tables 3–6) and CNV (Supplemental Table 7) events identified in this study. This data provides the genomic coordinates of identified CNV-deletions and MEI events. Additionally, normalized read count of impacted genes, along with their adjusted p-values of statistical analysis were presented (Supplemental Tables 3–6).</p>

Data from: Global Meta-Analysis of Cotton Yield and Weed Suppression from Cover Crops,"<p>On 19 June 2014, we conducted a two-tiered search (through that date) on the Web of Science Core Collection, CAB International, MEDLINE, Biological Abstracts, FSTA (Food Science and Technology Abstracts), and Zoological Record databases, using the ISI Web of Science search tool. We located 239,571 unique publications with the search terms: cotton OR Gossypium. A search of these records using the term “cover crop” resulted in 424 publications, composed of refereed articles, conference proceedings, research reports, and bulletins. With examination of these 424 eligible publications, 320 were excluded because they met our exclusion criteria: means for cover crop or no-cover crop treatments were not included, cotton yield or weed growth were not reported, article was a duplicate, article did not contain primary data (review or book), or they were not obtainable using interlibrary loan services (five articles). We did not include intercropping (cover crops grown simultaneously with cotton) studies, nor did we include studies that used weed count as the response variable. For the weed biomass effect size (ES), if an experiment included both weed and weed-free fallow no-cover-crop controls, we used the weed fallow no-cover-crop control in our analysis. If an experiment included herbicides applied over all treatments in season, we excluded the weed biomass ES but included the cotton biomass ES. We identified 104 articles that met our screening criteria (a full citation list and details of primary studies are provided in the supplemental material). Papers spanned 48 yr and were in English and Portuguese languages.</p>
<p>Treatment means and number of replications (sample sizes) were collected for each study. For publications reporting means for more than one no-cover-crop (control) treatment in a nonfactorial experiment, we used the no-cover-crop control that most closely approximated the cover crop treatment. If replications were given as a range, we used the smallest value. For studies that did not report number of replications, we used n = 1 unless LSD or SEs were provided, in which case we used n = 2. If data were provided in graphical form, means were extracted using WebPlotDigitizer (Rogatgi, 2011).</p>
<p>Multiple treatment combinations from one article were treated as independent studies (also referred to as trials or paired observations in the meta-analysis literature) and represented individual units in the meta-analysis. For example, Ashworth et al. (2018) and Li et al. (2013) examined the effects of two cover crop species over 3 yr, resulting in six studies from that article for lint yield ES. Vasilakoglou et al. (2011) studied control of three weed genera by four varieties of one cover crop species, resulting in 12 studies for the weed control ES. Although, the use of multiple studies from one publication has the disadvantage of increasing the dependence among studies that are assumed to be independent (Gurevitch and Hedges, 1999), the greater number of studies maximizes the meta-analysis’ statistical power (Lajeuness and Forbes, 2003). This approach has been used often in agricultural and plant biology meta-analyses (Mayerhofer et al., 2013; McGrath and Lobell, 2013; Ferraretto and Shaver, 2015). Therefore, we derived 1117 studies from 104 articles. As in prior meta-analyses (Ashworth et al., 2018; Mayerhofer et al., 2013), we used the final time point in the meta-analysis for studies that included data for multiple time points in one season. One exception was weed control, as an article used in this meta-analysis reported means that were recorded at three time points during the season (Norsworthy et al., 2010). Considering that each year of an experiment provides varying growing conditions only weakly correlated with other years (repeated measures across years is not needed in our experience), we considered each year as an independent study in the meta-analysis.</p>

"Data from: Grain inoculated with different growth stages of the fungus, Aspergillus flavus, affect the close-range foraging behavior by a primary stored product pest, Sitophilus oryzae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)","<p>Our goals with this dataset were to 1) isolate, culture, and identify two fungal life stages of Aspergillus flavus, 2) characterize the volatile emissions from grain inoculated by each fungal morphotype, and 3) understand how microbially-produced volatile organic compounds (MVOCs) from each fungal morphotype affect foraging, attraction, and preference by S. oryzae. This dataset includes that derived from headspace collection coupled with GC-MS, where we found the sexual life stage of A. flavus had the most unique emissions of MVOCs compared to the other semiochemical treatments. This translated to a higher arrestment with kernels containing grain with the A. flavus sexual life stage, as well as a higher cumulative time spent in those zones by S. oryzae in a video-tracking assay in comparison to the asexual life stage. While fungal cues were important for foraging at close-range, the release-recapture assay indicated that grain volatiles were more important for attraction at longer distances. There was no significant preference between grain and MVOCs in a four-way olfactometer, but methodological limitations in this assay prevent broad interpretation. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of how fungal cues affect the foraging ecology of a primary stored product insect.</p>
<p>In the assays described herein, we analyzed the behavioral response of Sitophilus oryzae to five different blends of semiochemicals found and introduced in wheat (Table 1). Briefly, these included no stimuli (negative control), UV-sanitized grain, clean grain from storage (unmanipulated, positive control), as well as grain from storage inoculated with fungal morphotype 1 (M1, identified as the asexual life stage of Aspergillus flavus) and fungal morphotype 2 (M2, identified as the sexual life stage of A. flavus). Fresh samples of semiochemicals were used for each day of testing for each assay. In order to prevent cross-contamination, 300 g of grain (tempered to 15% grain moisture) was initially sanitized using UV for 20 min. This procedure was done before inoculating grain with either morphotype 1 or 2. The 300 g of grain was kept in a sanitized mason jar (8.5 D × 17 cm H). To inoculate grain with the two different morphologies, we scraped an entire isolation from a petri dish into the 300 g of grain. Each isolation was ~1 week old and completely colonized by the given morphotype. After inoculation, each treatment was placed in an environmental chamber (136VL, Percival Instruments, Perry, IA, USA) set at constant conditions (30°C, 65% RH, and 14:10 L:D). This procedure was the same for both morphologies and was done every 2 weeks to ensure fresh treatments for each experimental assay.</p>

<p>Host-microbe interactions are increasingly recognized as important drivers of organismal health, growth, longevity, and community-scale ecological processes. However, less is known about how genetic variation affects hosts' associated microbiomes and downstream phenotypes. We demonstrate that sunflower <em>Helianthus annuus</em> harbors substantial, heritable variation in microbial communities under field conditions. We show that microbial communities co-vary with heritable variation in resistance to root infection caused by the necrotrophic pathogen <em>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</em>, and that plants grown in autoclaved soil showed almost complete elimination of pathogen resistance. Association mapping suggests at least 59 genetic locations with effects on both microbial relative abundance and <em>Sclerotinia</em> resistance. Although the genetic architecture appears quantitative, we have elucidated previously unexplained genetic variation for resistance to this pathogen. We identify new targets for plant breeding and demonstrate the potential for heritable microbial associations to play important roles in defense in natural and human-altered environments.</p>

"Data from: Honeydew associated with four common crop aphid species increases longevity of the parasitoid wasp, Bracon cephi (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)","<p>Data are from a laboratory experiment conducted to examine the potential effects of honeydew from six different aphid species by crop species combinations on the longevity of Bracon cephi Gahan (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), the most important biological control of the wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), a major pest of wheat in the northern Great Plains of North America. We quantified the number of days parasitoids lived on each honeydew type.</p>
<p>Abstract from published manuscript:<br />
The absence of sugar resources can be an important factor in limiting the success of parasitoids as biological control agents. Restoring vegetation complexity within agricultural landscapes has thus become a major focus of conservation biological control efforts, with a traditional emphasis on nectar resources. Aphid honeydew is also an important source of sugars that is infrequently considered. We carried out a laboratory experiment to examine the potential effects of honeydew from six different aphid species by crop species combinations on the longevity of Bracon cephi Gahan (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), the most important biological control of the wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), a major pest of wheat in the northern Great Plains of North America. The benefits of honeydew for parasitoid longevity varied significantly among different aphid and crop species, illustrating the complexity of these interactions. However, honeydew produced by four aphid species commonly found in wheat, pea, and canola crops significantly increased the longevity (by two- to threefold) of the parasitoid. The study suggests that honeydew provisioning could be an important mechanism underlying the benefits of crop diversification to support biological control that merits further research.</p>

"Data from: Host plant water deficit stress impairs reproduction and development of the galling fly (Parafreutreta regalis), a biological control agent of Cape-ivy (Delairea odorata)","<p>Data from choice and no-choice tests associated with the paper cited below. Drought leading to water deficit stress is known to reduce performance of galling insects. The shoot tip-galling fly <em>Parafreutreta regalis</em> has been released for biological control of Cape-ivy (<em>Delairea odorata</em>) in California. Lack of moisture during the dry season causes wilting of Cape-ivy shoots, and subsequent reduced host quantity and quality could influence the fly’s ability to multiply and establish. We imposed water deficit stress on potted Cape-ivy plants, then measured the plant’s and insect’s response to water deficit compared to fully-watered plants. Water deficit stress was imposed during female oviposition (short-term), gall development (long-term), or full insect life cycle (long-term). Plants subjected to long-term water deficit showed declines in shoot growth, leaf area, and total biomass. In choice tests, 72% fewer galls were found on water deficit stressed plants, but there was no difference in the numbers of insects per gall. In no-choice tests, long-term water deficit reduced the number and size of galls by up to 51% and 39%, respectively, and puparia inside the galls were up to 35% smaller. Long-term water deficit also increased the time required for the insect to complete its life cycle (egg to adult) by about 10 days, and up to 80% fewer adults emerged, decreasing the fly’s rate of increase by up to five-fold. Our study shows that <em>P. regalis</em> will oviposit and develop successfully on water deficit-stressed plants, but declines in female preference, insect development and abundance could inhibit fly field establishment and/or population growth under climatic drought conditions.</p>

Data from: Host specificity of Aphelinus species collected from soybean aphid in Asia,"<p>The soybean aphid, <em>Aphis glycines</em> Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is native to Asia where it is an occasional pest of soybean, <em>Glycine max</em> (L.). <em>Aphis glycines</em> was found during 2000 in North America and since then has spread throughout much of the area where soybean is grown. In Asia, <em>A. glycines</em> seldom reaches damaging levels; however in North America, it has become the most important insect pest of soybean, decreasing yields and incurring large control costs. Field surveys and exclosure experiments in China showed that natural enemies can limit soybean aphid abundance. A project to find, evaluate, and introduce Asian natural enemies into North America was initiated in 2001, with an emphasis on parasitoids. To ensure that introductions of exotic parasitoids would have minimum impact on non-target species, we tested host specificity of all candidates for introduction. These data sets provide results of no-choice laboratory experiments on host specificity of 13 populations in seven species from three species complexes in the genus <em>Aphelinus</em> (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae). They also provide results of experiments on the mechanisms of host specificity in three parasitoid species with narrow host ranges.</p>

Data from: Host specificity of Aphelinus species considered for introduction to control Diuraphis noxia,"<p>Diuraphis noxia, the Russian wheat aphid, has become a major pest of wheat and barley since first being detected in the western USA in 1986. However, it is rarely a pest in Eurasia, its area of origin, and research has shown that natural enemies can limit its abundance there. Among the most important of natural enemies of D. noxia in Eurasia are parasitoids in the genus Aphelinus. These data are results of laboratory experiments on host specificity of ten populations of seven species from two species complexes in the genus Aphelinus. Host specificity was not related to host plant species or the phylogenetic relatedness of the aphids or the parasitoids. While some species had very broad host ranges and others had intermediate host ranges, Aphelinus hordei had a very narrow host range, being restricted primarily to species in the genus Diuraphis, and especially D. noxia. We also report the results of experiments on the mechanisms of this host specificity. Most of the host specificity of A. hordei can be explained by differences in the behavior of females when they encountered different aphid species. Females of A. hordei rarely approach, sting, oviposit or host feed on aphids outside the genus Diuraphis, and they oviposit most frequently in D. noxia. From these results, we conclude that A. hordei is an excellent candidate for introduction into the USA to control D. noxia.</p>

"Data from: How Hives Collapse: Allee Effects, Ecological Resilience, and the Honey Bee","<p>A mathematical model is constructed to quantify the loss of resilience in collapsing honey bee colonies due to the presence of a strong Allee effect. In the model, recruitment and mortality of adult bees have substantial social components, with recruitment enhanced and mortality reduced by additional adult bee numbers. The result is an Allee effect, a net per-individual rate of hive increase that increases as a function of adult bee numbers. The Allee effect creates a critical minimum size in adult bee numbers, below which mortality is greater than recruitment, with ensuing loss of viability of the hive. Under ordinary and favorable environmental circumstances, the critical size is low, and hives remain large, sending off viably-sized swarms (naturally or through beekeeping management) when hive numbers approach an upper stable equilibrium size (carrying capacity). However, both the lower critical size and the upper stable size depend on many parameters related to demographic rates and their enhancement by bee sociality. Any environmental factors that increase mortality, decrease recruitment, or interfere with the social moderation of these rates has the effect of exacerbating the Allee effect by increasing the lower critical size and substantially decreasing the upper stable size. As well, the basin of attraction to the upper stable size, defined by the model potential function, becomes narrower and shallower, indicating the loss of resilience as the hive becomes subjected to increased risk of falling below the critical size. Environmental effects of greater severity can cause the two equilibria to merge and the basin of attraction to the upper stable size to disappear, resulting in collapse of the hive from any initial size. The model suggests that multiple proximate causes, among them pesticides, mites, pathogens, and climate change, working singly or in combinations, could trigger hive collapse.

"Data from: Identification and functional characterization of immunity-suppressing, candidate effector proteins in the parasitic weed Phelipanche aegyptiaca","<p>All source data from the referenced paper (Figures 1b and Table 1). 22 Excel files of data from each experimental block of the reactive oxygen species assay, 1 Excel file of the combined data from the bacterial growth enhancement assay, 1 Excel file of the RT-qPCR data.</p>
<p>Parasitic plants are the primary biotic constraint in many crop production systems. The most agriculturally devastating parasitic plants, including witchweeds (<em>Striga spp.</em>) and broomrapes (<em>Phelipanche and Orobanche spp.</em>), are in the <em>Orobanchaceae</em> family. <em>Phelipanche aegyptiaca</em> is an obligate holoparasite that lacks the capacity for photosynthesis and therefore relies on host parasitization for acquisition of all nutrients. <em>P. aegyptiaca</em> is a broad host range pathogen with the ability to parasitize diverse dicot hosts through attachment and development of a feeding structure known as a haustorium. The mechanisms <em>P. aegyptiaca</em> and other parasitic plants employ to avoid host plant immunity and form successful haustorial attachments are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that <em>P. aegyptiaca</em> actively suppresses salicylic acid-mediated immunity of the host plant <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em>. We hypothesized that parasitic plants may deploy immunity-suppressing effector proteins through the haustorial interface to subvert host plant immune responses. We devised a pipeline to select and clone 27 candidate secreted effector proteins in <em>P. aegyptiaca</em> and tested these proteins for the potential to suppress known plant immunity pathways. Five candidate effectors suppressed flg22-elicited production of reactive oxygen species when transiently expressed in <em>Nicotiana benthamiana</em>. We propose that two of these candidate effectors function through interfering with pattern triggered immunity using molecular mimicry.</p>

Data from: Identification of robust yield QTL derived from cultivated emmer for durum wheat improvement,"<p>Phenotypic Data<br />
Two durum × cultivated emmer recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations were evaluated for grain yield components under field conditions in North Dakota, USA. The BP025 population was developed by crossing Ben (PI 596557), a North Dakota hard amber durum variety, with PI 41025, a cultivated emmer accession collected near Samara, Russia. The BP025 population consists of 200 RILs developed by single seed-descent and was advanced to the F7:8 generation. The RP883 population was developed by crossing the durum line Rusty (PI 639869) with PI 193883, a cultivated emmer wheat accession collected near Shewa, Ethiopia. The RP883 population consists of 190 RILs developed by single seed-descent and was advanced to the F7:8 generation.<br />
The two populations were evaluated under field conditions in a total of three seasons for each and were grown in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replicates per season. Plants were grown in hill plots with each plot consisting of 10-15 seeds and considered an experimental unit. The BP025 population was planted and evaluated in 2017, 2018, and 2019. The RP883 population was evaluated in 2018, 2019, and 2020. The 2017, 2018, and 2019 plots were grown at the North Dakota State University field site near Prosper, ND (47.002°N, 97.115°W), and the 2020 plots were grown at the NDSU agronomy seed farm near Casselton, ND (46.880°N, 97.243°W). The BP025 and RP883 populations and parental lines were evaluated for 11 traits including days to heading (DTH), plant height (PHT), the total number of spikelets per spike (SPS), kernels per spike (KPS), grain weight per spike (GWS), thousand kernel weight (TKW), kernel area (KA), kernel width (KW), kernel length (KL), kernel circularity (KC), and kernel length:width ratio (KLW). DTH was measured as the number of days from planting until 50 % of the spikes emerged completely beyond the flag leaf. PHT was measured in centimeters from the base of the plot to the tip of the tallest spike (excluding awns). Eight heads were used for phenotypic evaluations. SPS was counted as the total number of spikelets per spike. KPS, GWS, TKW, KA, KW, KL, KC, and KLW were obtained using a MARVIN grain analyzer (GAT Sensorik GMBH, Neubrandenburg, Germany). For KPS and GWS, the value obtained by the MARVIN for each sample was divided by the number of spikes in that sample to obtain KPS and GWS for data analysis.<br />

Data from: Identification of stable QTL controlling multiple yield components in a durum × cultivated emmer wheat population under field and greenhouse conditions,"<p>Phentoypic data<br />
The durum × cultivated emmer recombinant inbred line (RIL) population (referred to as DP527) was evaluated for grain yield components under greenhouse and field conditions in North Dakota, USA. The DP527 population was developed by crossing Divide (PI 642021), a North Dakota hard amber durum variety, with PI 272527, a cultivated emmer accession collected near Pest, Hungary. The DP527 population consisted of 219 RILs developed using the single-seed descent method to the F7 generation and bulked to produce F7:8 RILs.<br />
The DP527 population was evaluated under field conditions in a total of three seasons and were grown in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three replicates each season. Plants were grown in hill plots, with each plot consisting of 10-15 seeds and considered an experimental unit. The 2017 and 2019 plots were grown at the North Dakota State University (NDSU) field site near Prosper, ND (47.002°N, 97.115°W). The 2020 plots were grown at the NDSU agronomy seed farm near Casselton, ND (46.880°N, 97.243°W).<br />
The DP527 population and parental lines were phenotyped for 11 traits including days to heading (DTH), plant height (PHT), total number of spikelets per spike (SPS), kernels per spike (KPS), grain weight per spike (GWS), thousand kernel weight (TKW), kernel area (KA), kernel width (KW), kernel length (KL), kernel circularity (KC), and kernel length:width ratio (KLW). DTH was measured as the number of days from planting until 50% of the spikes emerged completely beyond the flag leaf. PHT was measured from the base of the hill plot to the tip of the highest spike (excluding awns) in the plot in centimeters. Eight heads from each replicate were used for phenotypic evaluations. SPS was counted as the total number of spikelets divided by the number of heads in the sample. KPS, GWS, TKW, KA, KW, KL, KC, and KLW data were obtained using a MARVIN grain analyzer (GAT Sensorik GMBH, Neubrandenburg, Germany). KPS and GWS data from the MARVIN was divided by the number of heads in the sample to obtain an average per wheat head. For the 2019 environment, planting occurred in late May, and by early September about one third of the lines were not mature. Therefore, only DTH, PHT, and SPS were evaluated in the 2019 field season.<br />
The DP527 population and parents were evaluated under greenhouse conditions in two greenhouse seasons (2018 and 2019) with two replicates per season. Plants were grown in 15 cm diameter pots in a greenhouse with 16-h photoperiod and a temperature of 21 °C. All plants were grown in a completely randomized design (CRD) with one plant per pot, which was one experimental unit. DTH was measured as the number of days from planting until the emergence of the first spike beyond the flag leaf, and PHT was measured from the base of the plant to the tip of the highest spike in centimeters. Plants were hand harvested and four heads per plant were used for the rest of the phenotypic evaluations, which were measured as described for field environments.<br />
In the data file, column headings indicate the trait evaluated, the year, field vs greenhouse, and replicate or average of all three replicates.

Data from: Identifying Critical Life Stage Transitions for Biological Control of Long-lived Perennial Vincetoxicum Species,"<p>This dataset includes data on 25 transitions of a matrix demographic model of the invasive species <em>Vincetoxicum nigrum</em> (L.) Moench (black swallow-wort or black dog-strangling vine) and <em>Vincetoxicum rossicum</em> (Kleopow) Barb. (pale swallow-wort or dog-strangling vine) (Apocynaceae, subfamily Asclepiadoideae), two invasive perennial vines in the northeastern U.S.A. and southeastern Canada. The matrix model was developed for projecting population growth rates as a result of changes to lower-level vital rates from biological control although the model is generalizable to any control tactic. Transitions occurred among the five life stages of seeds, seedlings, vegetative juveniles (defined as being in at least their second season of growth), small flowering plants (having 1–2 stems), and large flowering plants (having 3 or more stems). Transition values were calculated using deterministic equations and data from 20 lower-level vital rates collected from 2009-2012 from two open field and two forest understory populations of <em>V. rossicum</em> (43°51’N, 76°17’W; 42°48'N, 76°40'W) and two open field populations of <em>V. nigrum</em> (41°46’N, 73°44’W; 41°18’N, 73°58’W) in New York State. Sites varied in plant densities, soil depth, and light levels (forest populations). Detailed descriptions of vital rate data collection may be found in: Milbrath et al. 2017. Northeastern Naturalist 24(1):37-53. Five replicate sets of transition data obtained from five separate spatial regions of a particular infestation were produced for each of the six populations.</p>

Data from: Immediate and delayed movement of resistant and susceptible adults of Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) after short exposures to phosphine,"<p>The aim of the current study was to track the movement of phosphine-resistant and -susceptible adults of the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), which is a major pest of stored products, after brief exposures to phosphine. Exposures were followed for extended intervals to assess the recovery patterns, and how those patterns are related to known resistance to phosphine. A video-tracking procedure coupled with Ethovision software was used to assess movement after exposure.</p>
<p>Two strains of T. castaneum were used, one susceptible and one resistant to phosphine. The susceptible T. castaneum strain had been maintained in continuous culture without any known exposure to phosphine for &gt;30 years at the USDA-ARS Center for Grain and Animal Health Research (CGAHR), in Manhattan, KS, USA. The phosphine-resistant strain of T. castaneum was collected from wheat in Palmital, Brazil during 1988 (BRZ-5). The rearing media consisted of 95% organic, unbleached, wheat flour plus 5% brewer's yeast. Tribolium castaneum were reared under laboratory conditions of 27.5°C, and 65% relative humidity (R.H.), 14:10 L:D. Adults, of mixed sex and &lt;1 month old, were used in the exposure bioassays.</p>
<p>The protocol that was used in our bioassays to generate phosphine was the Phosphine Tolerance Test (Detia Degesch GmbH, Laudenbach, Germany) with some modifications, as performed by Agrafioti et al. 2021. In particular, the phosphine was generated within a plastic canister (5 L capacity) by adding 50 mL of water to two kit magnesium phosphide pellets. The concentration of phosphine gas inside the plastic canister was determined by using several dosimeter Draeger glass tubes (Draeger 25A, 0–10 000 ppm, Draeger Safety AG & Co., USA). Ten adults of each strain were placed in a plastic syringe of 100 mL with separate syringes used for each species and strain. Then, a specific gas quantity was removed from the canister with the syringe and blended with fresh air to produce a 100-mL volume with a concentration of either 1000 or 3000 ppm and compared to phosphine-free controls (0 ppm). The insects inside the syringe were held at the concentrations above for a 5 min exposure, while additional syringes containing only fresh air and insects were used as negative controls.</p>
<p>To understand the propensity for movement after a 5 min phosphine exposure, a video-tracking procedure was used. After exposure of phosphine-resistant or phosphine-susceptible T. castaneum for 5 min, adult movement was evaluated immediately after exposure or 24 h later under the same environmental chamber conditions as the colonies (see Source Insects), but held without supplemental food. Movement was recorded for 3 h immediately after phosphine exposure but binned into 30 min intervals (e.g., 0–30, 30–60, 60–120, 120–150, and 150–180 min) in order to evaluate how movement varied over the measured time period. Movement was also recorded 24 h after exposure for periods of 1 h (binned by 30 min intervals). Movement measures of adults was tracked in six replicate Petri dishes (90 × 15 mm D:H) with a piece of filter paper (85 mm D, Grade 1, GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom) lining the bottom using a network camera (GigE, Basler AG, Ahrenburg, Germany) affixed 80 cm above the dishes. The Petri dishes were backlit using a LED light box (42 × 30 cm W:L, LPB3, Litup, Shenzhen, China) to increase contrast and affixed in place with white foam board with holes specifically cut to size for the petri dishes. Video was streamed to a nearby computer and processed in Ethovision (v. 14.0.1322, Noldus Inc., Leesburg, VA). The software was used to calculate the total distance moved (cm) and the mean instantaneous velocity (cm/s) for each adult. Each adult was considered a replicate and was never used more than once. Only adults classified as alive (normal movement speed and activity), or affected (sluggish movements or on back with legs twitching) were used in this assay. In total, 21–41 replicates were performed per treatment combination immediately after exposure, while 15–30 replicates were performed 24 h after exposure to phosphine. A total of 1525 adults were tested.</p>
<p>There are two time periods (immediately after exposure and 24 h later), and two response variables (total distance moved in cm and mean instantaneous velocity in cm/s). There were three fixed explanatory variables: concentration of phosphine (0, 1000, or 3000 ppm), susceptibility (phosphine-susceptible or phosphine-resistant strain), and time interval (maximally 0–30, 30–60, 60–120, 120–150, and 150–180 min).</p>

Data from: Implied climate warming contributions of enteric methane emissions are dependent on the estimate source and accounting methodology,"<p>This dataset was used in the generation of the manuscript titled: Implied climate warming contributions of enteric methane emissions are dependent on the estimate source and accounting methodology (DOI: 10.15232/aas.2022-02344). The objectives of this manuscript were to (1) demonstrate the differences in enteric methane emission estimates between 2 reporting entities (FAO and EPA) and to (2) demonstrate how the implied contribution to climate warming caused by enteric methane is dependent on accounting methodologies. The accounting methodologies explored were the conventional global warming potential (GWP) based on a 100-year time horizon (GWP100) or the newer GWP*. The GWP* methodology was developed because GWP100 fails to capture the short atmospheric lifespan of CH4, which is only 12-years (EPA, 2021a). The equations to calculate GWP100 (Equation 1; IPCC, 2013) and GWP* (Equation 2; Smith et al., 2021) are:</p>
<p>CH4, Mt CO2 equivalence = 28 × CH4(t) [Equation 1];<br />
CH4, Mt CO2-we = (4.53 × CH4(t) – 4.25 × CH4(t–20)) × 28 [Equation 2].</p>
<p>Where CH4(t) is the CH4 emitted in million metric tons (Mt) at year t and CH4(t-20) is the amount of CH4 emitted in Mt 20-years prior.<br />

"Data from: Importance of color for artificial clay caterpillars as sentinel prey in maize, soybean, and prairie","<p>Data files for manuscript titled ""Importance of color for artificial clay caterpillars as sentinel prey in maize, soybean, and prairie"".</p>
<p>Metadata is contained within excel file that describes all variables for each tab.</p>
<p>Abstract from paper:<br />
The use of artificial clay caterpillars to measure predation pressure under real field conditions is one method that has garnered recent support for quantifying ecosystem services that beneficial insects provide. Here, we focus on color and ask whether it is an important variable that should be considered in studies using clay caterpillars as sentinel prey. We deployed a total of 1920 brown, cream, green, gray, terracotta, and white clay caterpillars onto maize, soybean, and prairie plants to test if lighter colored caterpillars will be attacked and retrieved more than caterpillars with darker colors. As hypothesized, color was a significant predictor with green and terracotta caterpillars performing best, whereas brown and gray caterpillars performed the worst. Interestingly, clay caterpillars were also attacked proportionally to the number of insects in the surrounding habitat. Combined, we suggest artificial clay caterpillars could be useful for rapid ecosystem function assessments, but only when their color is considered.</p>

Data from: Infestation ratings database for soybean aphid on early-maturity wild soybean lines,"<p>Soybean aphid (<em>Aphis glycines</em> Matsumura; SA) is a major invasive pest of soybean [<em>Glycine max</em> (L.) Merr.] in northern production regions of North America. Although insecticides are currently the main method for controlling this pest, SA-resistant cultivars are being developed to sustainably manage SA in the future. The viability of SA-resistant cultivars may depend on identifying a diverse set of resistance genes from screening various germplasm sources, including wild soybean (<em>Glycine soja</em> Siebold and Zucc.), the progenitor of cultivated soybean. Data consisted of infestation ratings generated for a total of 337 distinct plant introduction lines of wild soybean that were exposed to avirulent SA biotype 1 for 14 d in 25 separate tests. Individual plants of the test lines were given a common rating by two researchers, based on a rating scale that progressed from 1=0 to 50, 2=51 to 100, 3=101 to 150, 4=151 to 200, 5=201 to 250, and 6 with &gt;250 SA per test plant. Public dissemination of this dataset will allow for further analyses and evaluation of resistance among the test lines.</p>

Data from: Insecticidal Management of Rangeland Grasshoppers Using Remotely Piloted Aerial Application System,"<p>Grasshoppers are integral parts of rangeland ecosystems but also have the potential to reach population densities high enough (outbreaks) to cause serious economic damage from forage loss and affect adjacent crops. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of treating grasshopper population hotspots with a liquid insecticide using a remotely piloted aerial application system (RPAAS), as opposed to fixed-wing aircraft, which is the most common method currently in use. A liquid insecticide, Sevin XLR PLUS (containing carbaryl), was applied on replicated 4.05-hectare (10-acre) plots with an RPAAS on a ranch in New Mexico. Our results demonstrated that Sevin XLR PLUS significantly suppressed grasshopper populations over a 14-day period (normalized population reduction was 79.11 ± 8.35% SEM) and quite rapidly (mostly by day 3) compared to untreated controls. These results are comparable to those achieved with fixed-wing aircraft. The RPAAS covered the whole test area in a single flight in approximately 5 min, making these population hotspot treatment applications relatively rapid, potentially more cost-effective, and more targeted in comparison to fixed-wing aircraft. Before adoption as an application method option, further research is recommended on using an RPAAS to cover larger areas in combination with using diflubenzuron-based insecticides, which are often preferred.</p>

Data from: Interseeded cover crop mixtures influence soil water storage during the corn phase of corn-soybean-wheat no-till cropping systems,"<p>Cover crop (CC) growth and biomass production in the Mid-Atlantic region can be limited following double crop soybean due slow establishment related cool fall temperatures. Interseeding CC in summer before soybean canopy closure can improve establishment and spring biomass production. This practice can also increase the diversity of available CC species, reduce weed pressure and reduce nutrient losses. This study evaluates the effects of interseeded CC on soil temperature, soil water balances, evapotranspiration, infiltration, and yield and water use efficiency of corn (<em>Zea mays</em> L.)  phase, following soybean (<em>Glycine max</em> L.) The study was conducted at the USDA Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Beltsville, MD from 2017 through 2020.  The cropping systems under study were primarily sequences of corn-soybean-wheat (<em>Triticum aestivum</em> L.)-double crop soybean all planted with no-tillage management. No cover crops (NC) were grown prior to corn in Systems 3 and 4. In System 5, a cover crop (CC) mixture of rye (<em>Secale cereal</em>e L.)-hairy vetch (<em>Vicia villosa</em> Roth)-crimson clover (<em>Trifolium incarnatum</em> L.) was interseeded into DCS prior to soybean canopy closure. In System 6, red clover (rc, <em>Trifolium pratense</em> L.) was interseeded into wheat in March and rye was planted into rc after wheat harvest in July.</p>

"Data from: Interspecific variation in persistence of buried weed seeds follows trade-offs among physiological, chemical and physical seed defenses","<p>This dataset includes data on the chemical, physical and biological traits of weed seeds of 11 arable weed species in relation to the persistence of these seeds in the soil seedbank within a common-garden burial study. We performed a common garden weed seed burial study at the University of Illinois Crop Sciences Research and Education Center in Savoy, IL (40.048757 N, -88.237206 E), from October 2007 through October 2012. The experiment was arranged in a split-plot design with four replications of the sub-plot variable species nested within main plot variable burial duration (1 to 5 years). Eleven annual weed species were included, spanning a broad range of seed sizes, dormancy types and seedbank persistence: <em>Abutilon theophrasti</em> Medik (velvetleaf), <em>Ambrosia trifida</em> L. (giant ragweed), <em>Amaranthus tuberculatus</em> [Moq]. Sauer (common waterhemp), <em>Bassia scoparia</em> [L.] A. J. Scott (kochia), <em>Chenopodium album</em> L. (common lambsquarters), <em>Ipomoea hederacea</em> Jacq. (ivyleaf morningglory), <em>Panicum miliaceum</em> L. (wild proso millet), <em>Polygonum pensylvanicum</em> L. (Pennsylvania smartweed), <em>Setaria faberi</em> Herrm. (giant foxtail), <em>Setaria pumila</em> [Poir] Roem. (yellow foxtail) and <em>Thlaspi arvense</em> L. (field pennycress).</p>
<p>Weed seeds were collected in 2007 from the experimental site and adjoining fields by gently shaking mature inflorescences over a bucket and bulking seeds from multiple plants to form a composite sample for each species. Light seed were removed by processing with a seed cleaner, after which seeds were stored in air tight containers at 4C until burial. Immediately prior to burial, seed viability was assayed with tetrazolium. Burial units consisted of 100 seeds of a given species placed in the bottom of a 2.5 cm deep square tray, 10 cm on a side, made of 0.5 mm stainless steel wire mesh. Tray bottoms were permeable to water, but prevented seeds from escaping. Trays were filled 2 cm deep with soil from a nearby grass sward that had not been cropped for over 30 years, to avoid contamination with weed seeds (verified by elutriating samples of this soil). Within each experimental unit, we excavated a 2 cm deep rectangle 30 cm wide by 40 cm long, and placed trays for each of the 11 species side by side into this depression so that their soil surface was flush with the surrounding soil, leaving a 0.5 cm wire mesh lip exposed in each tray. Each experimental unit was covered by wire mesh with 1 cm square openings to permit access to invertebrate granivores. The study plot was fenced to exclude large vertebrates.</p>
<p>Seedling emergence was recorded weekly from March through October every year. Seed trays for a given burial duration treatment were removed in October of the assigned year and seeds recovered via elutriation (Wiles et al. 1996). Recovered seeds were incubated under oscillating temperature conditions (15 C/dark for 10 hr, 25 C/light for 14 hr) for 2 weeks and germination recorded. Ungerminated seeds assessed as viable through tetrazolium testing were considered dormant.</p>
<p>SEED TRAITS<br />
We measured chemical and physical seed traits on freshly collected seeds following the methods outlined in Tiansawat et al. (2014), using multiple measures of each trait class to provide functional redundancy and allow them to be treated as latent or manifest variables during multivariate analyses. For the chemical defense trait class we measured ortho-dihydroxyphenol (o-DHP) concentration, abundance and diversity of phenolic compounds quantified with high performance liquid chromatography, impact of seed homogenate on brine shrimp survival, and seed removal by invertebrate granivores. Physical traits measured included seed coat thickness, seed mass, and seed coat rupture force. Pairwise interspecific phylogenetic distances were quantified using the phydist subroutine of Phylocom 4.2 (<a href=""http://www.phylodiversity.net"">www.phylodiversity.net</a>). Also included is a list of references from the associated literature review.</p>

Data from: Less is more: Fewer attract-and-kill sites improve the male annihilation technique against Bactrocera dorsalis,"<p>The Male Annihilation Technique (also termed the Male Attraction Technique; “MAT”) is often used to eradicate pestiferous tephritid fruit flies, such as <em>Bactrocera dorsalis</em> (Hendel). MAT involves the application of male-specific attractants combined with an insecticide in spots or stations across an area to reduce the male population to such a low level that suppression or eradication is achieved. Currently, implementations of MAT in California and Florida targeting <em>B. dorsalis</em> utilize the male attractant methyl eugenol (ME) accompanied with a toxicant, such as spinosad, mixed into a waxy, inert emulsion STATIC ME (termed here “SPLAT-MAT-ME”). While highly effective against ME-responding species, such applications are expensive owing largely to the high cost of the carrier matrix and labor for application.  Until recently the accepted protocol called for the application of approximately 230 SPLAT-MAT-ME spots per km2; however, findings from Hawaii suggest a lower density may actually be more effective. The present study adopted the methods of that earlier work and estimated kill rates of released <em>B. dorsalis</em> under varying spot densities in areas of California and Florida that have had recent incursions of this invasive species. Specifically, we directly compared trap captures of sterilized marked <em>B. dorsalis</em> males released in different plots under three experimental SPLAT-MAT-ME densities (50, 110, and 230 per km2) in Huntington Beach, CA; Anaheim, CA; and Sarasota-Bradenton, FL. The plots with a density of 110 sites per km2 had a significantly higher recapture proportion than plots with 50 or 230 sites per km2. This result suggests that large amounts of male attractant may reduce the ability of males to locate the source of the odor, thus lowering kill rates and the effectiveness of eradication efforts. Eradication programs would directly benefit from reduced costs and improved eradication effectiveness by reducing the application density of SPLAT-MAT-ME.</p>

Survivorship was calculated as the last day egg counts were recorded for an individual. Blocks were adults that were all mated on the same day. Reps are an individual female. Control beetles are coded with either an ""f"" or an ""m"" for female and male and were never mated. Male control data was examined for similarity to female control data but was not used in further analysis and comparison. The experiment was all done at 30C, 65% relative humidity and a 16 light/8 dark photoperiod. Adults were transferred every 2 days to new vials and eggs were then counted and save for progeny counts. Trogoderma variabile populations were laboratory colonies for over 20 years. T. inclusum populations were collected in Kansas in August of 2012. We did not transform these data.</p>

"Data from: Long-Distance Transportation Causes Temperature Stress in the Honey Bee, Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera: Apidae)","<p>Pollination services provided by the honey bee, <em>Apis mellifera</em> (Hymenoptera: Apidae, Linnaeus, 1758) have broad economic impacts and are necessary for production of a diversity of important crops. Hives may be transported multiple times per year to provide pollination. To test how temperature may contribute to transportation stress, temperature sensors were placed in hives in different locations and orientations on the trailer during shipping. Colony size prior to shipping significantly contributed to loss of population immediately after shipping which contributed to colony failure with smaller colonies more likely to fail and fail faster. Colony size also affects thermoregulation and temperature stress. Internal hive temperature varies significantly based on location and orientation. While colonies near the front and rear of the trailer and those oriented toward the center aisle had significantly different average internal temperatures, colony size best predicts loss of thermoregulation. Additionally, we profiled gene expression at departure, on arrival, and after a recovery period to identify transcriptional responses to transportation. Functional and enrichment analysis identified increased methylation and decreased ribosomal and protein-folding activity. Pheromone and odorant-binding transcripts were up-regulated after transportation. After recovery, transcripts associated with defense response, immune activity, and heat shock decreased, while production of antibiotic peptides increased. We conclude that hives experience considerable temperature stress possibly caused by turbulent airflow in exposed locations. Transportation stress should be considered an important component of annual colony losses which can be mitigated with improved management strategies.</p>

Data from: Long-Term Agroecosystem Research in the Central Mississippi River Basin: Goodwater Creek Experimental Watershed and Regional Herbicide Water Quality Data,"<p>The GCEW herbicide data were collected from 1991-2010, and are documented at plot, field, and watershed scales.</p>
<p>Atrazine concentrations in Goodwater Creek Experimental Watershed (GCEW) were shown to be among the highest of any watershed in the United States based on comparisons using the national Watershed Regressions for Pesticides (WARP) model and by direct comparison with the 112 watersheds used in the development of WARP. This 20-yr-long effort was augmented with a spatially broad effort within the Central Mississippi River Basin encompassing 12 related claypan watersheds in the Salt River Basin, two cave streams on the fringe of the Central Claypan Areas in the Bonne Femme watershed, and 95 streams in northern Missouri and southern Iowa. The research effort on herbicide transport has highlighted the importance of restrictive soil layers with smectitic mineralogy to the risk of transport vulnerability. Near-surface soil features, such as claypans and argillic horizons, result in greater herbicide transport than soils with high saturated hydraulic conductivities and low smectitic clay content.</p>

<p>Trial 1 Recapture - To understand whether the method by which LLIN was deployed affected subsequent commodity infestation and progeny production, pilot-scale warehouses (5.85 × 2.81 m) in Manhattan, KS were used. At the far end of the warehouse against the back wall, a commodity consisting of a mixture of 210 mL organic, whole wheat kernels and 210 mL of organic, unbleached flour was placed. A total of 100 individuals each of <em>T. castaneum</em>, <em>R. dominica</em>, and <em>T. variabile</em> were released at the opposite end of the warehouse (approx. 5.25 m away). There were n = 12 replicate releases per treatment from 26 April 2019 to 16 August 2019, comprising a total of 3,600 released insects. There were four LLIN deployment methods that were tested (Figure 2). In the “hanging” treatment, LLIN (2.72 × 2.41 m) was affixed to the warehouse ceiling and allowed to hang down to the floor, completely bisecting the room. In the “cover” deployment method, LLIN was directly laid over the commodity. In the “pipe” deployment method, a PVC pipe (91 cm length, 5.1 cm I.D.) was bisected halfway with LLIN. These were compared with a ""control"" that used the same PVC pipe design, but without netting. Insects were given 72 h to disperse across the warehouse to the commodity. After this period, insects were collected by pre-designated zones in the warehouse. The zones were noted respective to the location of the commodity, and included ""in commodity"" (inside the commodity), ""partial dispersal"" (0.5 m radius to 4.5 m away), and ""no dispersal"" (4.5 m–5.6 m away, e.g. the release zone). The insects were retrieved, and then brought back to the lab where their health condition was assessed as alive, affected, or dead.

<p>Trial 2 Recapture - To understand whether management tactic affected subsequent commodity infestation and progeny production, pilot-scale warehouses (5.85 × 2.81 m) in Manhattan, KS were used. There were four treatments in total applied to warehouses for this experiment: LLIN alone (L), AK-based interception trap alone (AK), both together (LAK), or neither (e.g. ""control"" that had no netting or interception trap). The zones were similar to the descriptions above, but a Zone 7 was introduced which described insects captured inside the interception traps (e.g. ""trap""). At the far end of the warehouse against the back wall, a commodity consisting of a mixture of 210 mL organic, whole wheat kernels and 210 mL of organic, unbleached flour was placed. A total of 100 individuals each of <em>T. castaneum</em>, <em>R. dominica</em>, and <em>T. variabile</em> were released at the opposite end of the warehouse (approx. 5.25 m away). There were n = 12 replicate releases per treatment from 23 August 2019 to 8 November 2019, comprising a total of 3,600 released insects.

Data from: Mapping the Quantitative Field Resistance to Stripe Rust in a Hard Winter Wheat Population ‘Overley’ × ‘Overland’,"<p>Data reported in research published in Crop Science, “Mapping the quantitative field resistance to stripe rust in a hard winter wheat population ‘Overley’ × ‘Overland.’”  Authors are Wardah Mustahsan, Mary J. Guttieri, Robert L. Bowden, Kimberley Garland-Campbell, Katherine Jordan, Guihua Bai, Guorong Zhang from USDA Agricultural Research Service and Kansas State University. This study was conducted to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with field resistance to stripe rust, also known as yellow rust (YR), in hard winter wheat. Stripe rust infection type and severity were rated in recombinant inbred lines (RILs, n=204) derived from a cross between hard red winter wheat cultivars ‘Overley’ and ‘Overland’ in replicated field trials in the Great Plains and Pacific Northwest. RILs (n=184) were genotyped with reduced representation sequencing to produce SNP markers from alignment to the ‘Chinese Spring’ reference sequence, IWGSC v2.1, and from alignment to the reference sequence for ‘Jagger’, which is a parent of Overley. Genetic linkage maps were developed independently from each set of SNP markers. QTL analysis identified genomic regions on chromosome arms 2AS, 2BS, 2BL, and 2DL that were associated with stripe rust resistance using multi-environment best linear unbiased predictors for stripe rust infection type and severity. Results for the two linkage maps were very similar. PCR-based SNP marker assays associated with the QTL regions were developed to efficiently identify these genomic regions in breeding populations.</p>
<p>Field response to YR was evaluated in seven trials: Rossville, KS (2018 and 2019), Hays, KS (2019), Pullman, WA (2019 and 2020) and Central Ferry, WA (2019 and 2020). An augmented experimental design was used at Rossville, KS with highly replicated checks and two full replications of RILs (n=187 in 2018; n=204 in 2019). The field experiment at Hays was arranged in a partially replicated augmented design with one or two replications of each RIL (n=194). The parental checks (Overley and Overland) were represented in three blocks for each of the two field replications at Hays, and RILs were distributed among blocks; not all RILs were present in each replication. RILs were arranged in an augmented design with two replications at Pullman (n=204 RILs) and Central Ferry (n=155 RILs in 2019; n=204 in 2020). At Pullman and Central Ferry.</p>
<p>The trials at Rossville, KS were inoculated using an inoculum consisting of equal parts of four isolates that were all virulent to Yr9. Two isolates were collected in Kansas in 2010 and had virulence to Yr17 but not QYr.tamu-2B. The other two isolates were from Kansas in 2012 and had virulence to QYr.tamu-2B, but not Yr17. Susceptible spreader rows (KS89180B, carrying Yr9) were inoculated several times during the tillering stage in the evenings with an ultra-low volume sprayer using a suspension of 2 mL of fresh urediniospores in 1 L of Soltrol 170 isoparaffin oil. Trials at Pullman, WA and Central Ferry, WA were evaluated under natural inoculum supplemented by a mixture of isolates collected in the previous field season. The trial at Hays, KS was evaluated under natural infection.</p>
<p>Data collection at Rossville, KS began once the susceptible check (KS89180B) had an infection severity coverage of ~10% and continued until senescence. In Rossville, disease ratings (IT and SEV) were collected on 16, 22, and 28th of May 2019. Most ratings in Rossville were taken some time after heading from Zadoks stages 55 to 70. In Pullman, disease ratings were collected on July 1 and 12. In Central Ferry, disease ratings were taken on 12th and 18th of June 2019. The second rating date was used for subsequent statistical analysis. In Hays, disease ratings were taken on June 1, 2019, when the plants were in early booting or heading stages (Zadoks 31-41). Stripe rust evaluations were measured using two disease rating scales: IT (0-9; from no infection to highly susceptible, Line and Qayoum, 1992) and SEV based on visual estimation of the percent flag leaf area affected by the pathogen including associated chlorosis and necrosis (0-100%).</p>
<p>DNA was extracted from seedlings, and genotyping-by-sequencing was conducted as described previously (Guttieri, 2020) on a subset of 189 lines (187 RILS and 2 parents) of which 23 RILs were F6-derived and 164 RILs were F9-derived. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in parallel using reference-based calling in the TASSEL pipeline (Bradbury et al., 2007) using both the IWGSC v2.1 reference genome (Zhu et al., 2021) and the Jagger reference sequence (Wheat Genomes Project (<a href=""http://www.10wheatgenomes.com/10-wheat-genomes-project-and-the-wheat-initiative/"">http://www.10wheatgenomes.com/10-wheat-genomes-project-and-the-wheat-ini...</a>). The TASSEL pipeline was executed with the following parameters: minimum read count = 1, minimum quality score = 0, minimum locus coverage = 0.19, and minimum minor allele frequency = 0.005, minimum heterozygous proportion = 0, and removal of minor SNP states. The resulting SNP datasets from each reference sequence were filtered in TASSEL by taxa (RILs) and sites (SNPs). The RILs were filtered to include those RILs for which at least 20% sites were present. The sites were filtered to include sites for which &gt; 60% of RILs were called, minor allele frequency (MAF) &gt; 0.25, maximum allele frequency &lt; 0.75, maximum heterozygous proportion = 0.25, and removal of minor SNP states. The ABH plugin in TASSEL was applied to this reduced dataset to identify parental genotypes.</p>

Data from: Metagenomic and near full-length 16S rRNA sequence data in support of the phylogenetic analysis of the rumen bacterial community in steers,"<p>Amplicon sequencing utilizing next-generation platforms has significantly transformed how research is conducted, specifically microbial ecology. However, primer and sequencing platform biases can confound or change the way scientists interpret these data. The Pacific Biosciences RSII instrument may also preferentially load smaller fragments, which may also be a function of PCR product exhaustion during sequencing. To further examine theses biases, data is provided from 16S rRNA rumen community analyses. Specifically, data from the relative phylum-level abundances for the ruminal bacterial community are provided to determine between-sample variability. Direct sequencing of metagenomic DNA was conducted to circumvent primer-associated biases in 16S rRNA reads and rarefaction curves were generated to demonstrate adequate coverage of each amplicon. PCR products were also subjected to reduced amplification and pooling to reduce the likelihood of PCR product exhaustion during sequencing on the Pacific Biosciences platform. The taxonomic profiles for the relative phylum-level and genus-level abundance of rumen microbiota as a function of PCR pooling for sequencing on the Pacific Biosciences RSII platform were provided.</p>

Data from: Microarray analysis of subcutaneous adipose tissue from mature cows with divergent body weight gain after feed restriction and realimentation,"<p>Body weight response to periods of feed restriction and realimentation is critical and relevant to the agricultural industry. The purpose of this study was to evaluate differentially expressed genes identified in subcutaneous adipose tissue collected from cows divergent in body weight (BW) gain after feed restriction and realimentation. We compared adipose samples from cows with greater gain based on average daily gain (ADG) during realimentation with samples from cows with lesser gain. Specifically, there were four comparisons including two comparing the high and low gain animals across each feeding period (feed restriction and realimentation) and two that compared differences in feed restriction and realimentation across high or low gain classifications. Using microarray analysis, we provide a set of differentially expressed genes identified between the high and low gain at both periods of nutrient restriction and realimentation. These data identify multiple differentially expressed genes between these two phenotypes across both nutritional environments.</p>

Data from: Microbial vectoring capacity by internal- and external-infesting stored product insects after varying dispersal periods between novel food patches: An underestimated risk,"<p>To determine whether colony populations of <em>Lasioderma serricorne</em> (cigarette beetle, CB) and <em>Sitophilus oryzae</em> (rice weevil, RW) vectored microbes, and to identify possible interactions with dispersal time, a vectoring assay was performed for each species. For the vectoring assay, the impact of dispersal (0, 24, or 72 h) and foraging time (3 or 5 d) on vectoring ability were tested.  Briefly, adult <em>L. serricorne</em> or <em>S. oryzae</em> were singly removed from colony containers with sterilized forceps and then placed immediately in the center of Petri dish containing agar for the 0 h dispersal period.  Alternatively, some insects were given a 24 or 72 h dispersal period in an autoclaved 4 L-capacity glass container and stored at constant conditions of 25°C, 60% RH, and 14:10 L:D photoperiod prior to being added to the PDA. Petri dishes were maintained at 30°C, 60% RH, and 14:10 L:D photoperiod for either 3 or 5 days, then photographed for microbial growth. Transfer of <em>L. serricorne</em> or <em>S. oryzae</em> adults from dispersal containers to agar at the conclusion of the dispersal period was performed inside the biosafety cabinet to prevent contamination of dishes.</p>
<p>Pictures of the agar dishes and corresponding microbial growth were taken using a DSLR camera (EOS 7D Mark II, Canon, Tokyo, Japan) mounted to 3D imaging StackShot (CogniSys, Inc., Traverse City, MI, USA) equipped with a dual flash (MT-26EX-RT, Canon, Tokyo, Japan). Light was diffused using a partially cut frosted plastic jar (15.2 × 7.6 cm D:H) making a total of n = 60 replicates per treatment combination (of dispersal time, insect species, and foraging time in patch). The pictures taken were processed using ImageJ 1.53a (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, USA) to quantify the microbial growth in the agar dishes. The images had their backgrounds subtracted, then were processed using the ""find edges"" tool. Finally, they were converted to binary and either dilated or eroded to conform to the original image parameters. A circle encompassing the Petri dish was created and the mean grayscale, standard deviation of the grayscale value, and count of pixels was measured as a surrogate for microbial growth on the dishes. This allowed a quantitative measure of microbial growth by creating an average in a given image. The mean grayscale value could range from 0 (full white), indicating no microbial growth, to 255 (full black), indicating full microbial growth on the entire dish. Finally, visually, microbial morphospecies (alpha) richness was assigned to each image given the number of unique morphospecies on the plate as a proxy for community complexity.</p>
<p>Treatments included those from microbially-enriched environments where <em>Aspergillus flavus</em> had been inoculated on wheat or flour (AF). To prepare the AF, 600 g of grain was added to a stainless-steel pot filled with water and placed on a hot plate at 500°C. Once boiling for 15 min, the water was drained and the grain was evenly spread out on sterile wipes (38.1 × 42.5 cm, 3 ply, Tech wipes, Skilcraft, NIB, Alexandria, VA) and allowed to dry inside a laminar fume hood (ca. 3 h). Afterwards, grain was evenly divided (~300 g) and placed in two separate autoclaved mason jars (950-mL capacity). A single hole was pierced through each lid and lined with a cotton ball. The jars were then sealed with aluminum foil and were autoclaved (533LS, Getinge, Rochester, NY, USA) for 30 min. To inoculate with <em>A. flavus</em>, a 3-inch strip of agar containing a pure culture of <em>A. flavus</em> grown on agar for 7 d at 30°C, 60% RH, and 14:10 L:D photoperiod was placed into each jar containing the grain. AF was then maintained at room temperature for roughly 10 d or until the A. flavus evenly covered as much the grain as possible. Batches of inoculated grain were used within 10–15 d of preparation. Grain was never used more than once for each replicate of every trial in each assay experiment to prevent cross contamination. A total of 75 insects were added to 300 g of AF in a 950-ml mason jar and allowed to forage for 2 weeks prior to use in the vectoring experiment. The same dispersal periods (0, 24, 72 h) and time in patch (3 and 5 d) described above were used for this experiment. The mean grayscale value and microbial morphospecies richness was recorded for each image. There were a total of n = 30 replicates per treatment combination.</p>
<p>Another treatment included field-collected individuals. To obtain sufficient numbers of adults, insects were caught at four different field sites around the area of greater Manhattan, KS including: 1) a site with a pre-harvest wheat field bordered by woodlands (39°14'26.2""N, 96°34'59.1""W), 2) local apartment complex consisting of end consumers (39°11'43.6""N, 96°36'07.4""W), 3) Kansas State University Agronomy Farm with storage silos (39°12'23.7""N, 96°35'43.2""W), and 4) a private residence adjacent to a working cattle farm (39°12'23.7""N, 96°35'43.2""W). In each location, a total of three 4-funnel Lindgren traps (Bioquip, Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA) were deployed at least 10 m apart at about 1 m height on rebar or hung from a tree along the perimeter of the location site, and were baited with a multi-species lure containing both <em>L. serricorne</em> sex pheromone and <em>Sitophilus</em> spp. pheromone (PTL bullet lure, #IL-108, and <em>Sitophilus</em> spp. bullet lure, #IL-703, Insects Limited, Westfield, IN, USA). In addition, three ground traps were deployed that consisted of commercially-available pitfall traps (Dome®, Storgard, Trécé, Adair, OK, USA) with two connectable pieces (Doud and Phillips 2020; Doud et al. 2021), containing a central well where a <em>Sitophilus</em> spp. lure was added along with a 5 g of whole maize as a kairomone bait. Pheromone lures were changed every 60 d. No kill mechanism was added because adults needed to be alive. Traps were checked on a daily basis for capture of new adults and brought immediately back into the laboratory in separate unused, sterilized containers for addition to agar dishes. Stored product insects were identified using taxonomic keys in USDA (1996). Dispersal period at 0 h and time in patch (3 and 5 d) as described above were used for this experiment.</p>

Data from: Mortality Dynamics of a Polyphagous Invasive Herbivore Reveal Clues in Its Agroecosystem Success,"<p>Field-based, partial life table data for immature stages of silverleaf whitefly, <em>Bemisia argentifolii</em>, on 6 host plants including alfalfa, broccoli, spring and fall cantaloupe, cotton, ornamental lantana, and several species of annual weeds in Maricopa, Marana and Yuma Arizona, USA. Data were collected on a total of 73 individual cohorts (each replicated 4 times) from November 2000 to April 2003 at all three study sites. For each cohort, data were generated on approximately 400 individual insects (200 eggs and 200 first instar nymphs). Data provide the marginal, cause-specific mortality for eggs, and 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th instar nymphs collectively and stage-specific marginal mortality for each stage over all causes. Mortality was characterized as caused by inviability (eggs only), dislodgement, predation, parasitism (nymphs only), desiccation, and unknown. Detailed methods can be found in Naranjo and Ellsworth 2005 (<em>Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata</em> 116(2): 93-108; <a href=""https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2005.00297.x"">https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2005.00297.x</a> ; and Naranjo and Ellsworth 2017 (<em>Journal of Visualized Experiments</em>, 129; <a href=""https://doi.org/10.3791/56150"">https://doi.org/10.3791/56150</a>). The method takes advantage of the sessile nature of immature stages of this insect. Briefly, an observer follows individual eggs or settled first instar nymphs from natural populations on the underside of host plant leaves in the field with a hand lens and determines causes of death for each individual over time. Weather data was monitored using the University of Arizona AzMet system. Note that these life table data do not include adult mortality or reproduction. The life table data were used to generate survivorship curves for each cohort on each host plant based on a physiological time scale of accumulated degree-days above 10C from the initiation of each cohort.</p>

Data from: Multilocus microsatellite analysis of 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' associated with citrus Huanglongbing worldwide,"<p>Huanglongbing (HLB) is one of the most destructive citrus diseases in the world. The disease is associated with the presence of a fastidious, phloem-limited α- proteobacterium, '<em>Candidatus</em> Liberibacter asiaticus', '<em>C</em>a. Liberibacter africanus' or '<em>C</em>a. Liberibacter americanus'. HLB-associated Liberibacters have spread to North America and South America in recent years. While the causal agents of HLB have been putatively identified, information regarding the worldwide population structure and epidemiological relationships for '<em>Ca</em>. L. asiaticus' is limited. The availability of the '<em>Ca</em>. L. asiaticus' genome sequence has facilitated development of molecular markers from this bacterium. The objectives of this study were to develop microsatellite markers and conduct genetic analyses of '<em>Ca</em>. L. asiaticus' from a worldwide collection. Two hundred eighty seven isolates from USA (Florida), Brazil, China, India, Cambodia, Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand, and Japan were analyzed.</p>
<p>A panel of seven polymorphic microsatellite markers was developed for '<em>Ca</em>. L. asiaticus'. Microsatellite analyses across the samples showed that the genetic diversity of '<em>Ca</em>. L. asiaticus' is higher in Asia than Americas. UPGMA and STRUCTURE analyses identified three major genetic groups worldwide. Isolates from India were genetically distinct. East-southeast Asian and Brazilian isolates were generally included in the same group; a few members of this group were found in Florida, but the majority of the isolates from Florida were clustered separately. eBURST analysis predicted three founder haplotypes, which may have given rise to three groups worldwide.</p>
<p>Results identified three major genetic groups of '<em>Ca</em>. L. asiaticus' worldwide. Isolates from Brazil showed similar genetic makeup with east-southeast Asian dominant group, suggesting the possibility of a common origin. However, most of the isolates recovered from Florida were clustered in a separate group. While the sources of the dominant '<em>Ca</em>. L. asiaticus' in Florida were not clearly understood, the less-pervasive groups may have been introduced directly from Asia or via Brazil. Notably, the recent outbreak of HLB in Florida probably occurred through multiple introductions. Microsatellite markers developed in this study provide adequate discriminatory power for the identification and differentiation of closely-related isolates, as well as for genetic studies of '<em>Ca</em>. L. asiaticus'.</p>

Data from: Multiscale climatological albedo look-up maps derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer BRDF/albedo products,"<p>Surface albedo determines radiative forcing and is a key parameter for driving Earth’s climate. Better characterization of surface albedo for individual land cover types can reduce the uncertainty in estimating changes to Earth’s radiation balance due to land cover change. The dataset includes albedo look-up maps (LUMs) using a multiscale hierarchical approach based on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)/albedo products and Landsat imagery. Ten years (2001 to 2011) of MODIS BRDF/albedo products were used to generate global albedo climatology. Albedo LUMs of land cover classes defined by the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) at multiple spatial resolutions were generated. The albedo LUMs included monthly statistics of white-sky (diffuse) and black-sky (direct) albedo for each IGBP class for visible, near-infrared, and shortwave broadband under both snow-free and snow-covered conditions. The LUMs provide high temporal and spatial resolution global albedo statistics without gaps for investigating albedo variations under different land cover scenarios and could be used for land surface modeling.</p>

Data from: Not just crop or forest: building an integrated land cover map for agricultural and natural areas (spatial files),"<h3>Introduction and Rationale:</h3>
<p>Due to our increasing understanding of the role the surrounding landscape plays in ecological processes, a detailed characterization of land cover, including both agricultural and natural habitats, is ever more important for both researchers and conservation practitioners. Unfortunately, in the United States, different types of land cover data are split across thematic datasets that emphasize agricultural or natural vegetation, but not both. To address this data gap and reduce duplicative efforts in geospatial processing, we merged two major datasets, the LANDFIRE National Vegetation Classification (NVC) and USDA-NASS Cropland Data Layer (CDL), to produce integrated ‘Spatial Products for Agriculture and Nature’ (SPAN). Our workflow leveraged strengths of the NVC and the CDL to produce detailed rasters comprising both agricultural and natural land-cover classes. We generated SPAN for each year from 2012-2021 for the conterminous United States, quantified agreement between input layers and accuracy of our merged product, and published the complete workflow necessary to update SPAN. In our validation analyses, we found that approximately 5.5% of NVC agricultural pixels conflicted with the CDL, but we resolved a majority of these conflicts based on surrounding agricultural land, leaving only 0.6% of agricultural pixels unresolved in the final version of SPAN.</p>

Data from: Pathogen webs in collapsing honey bee colonies,"<p>Here we explore the incidence and abundance of currently known honey bee pathogens in colonies suffering from Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD), otherwise weak colonies, and strong colonies from across the United States. This data set was generated in order to use deep RNA sequencing to further characterize microbial diversity in CCD and non-CCD hives. We identified novel strains of the recently described Lake Sinai viruses (LSV) and found evidence of a shift in gut bacterial composition that may be a biomarker of CCD. The results are discussed with respect to host-parasite interactions and other environmental stressors of honey bees.</p>
<p>RNA was pooled by combining equal aliquots from each CCD or non-CCD colony described above. Five µg of RNA from the “CCD−” pool was used to generate cDNA using a cocktail of random heptamer primers. cDNA was size-selected from agarose and end-polished with End Repair Enzyme (Illumina) following manufacturer protocols. A 3′ polyadenine tract was then added with Klenow fragment (Invitrogen) and the products purified with a Qiaquick DNA purification column (Qiagen). Illumina adapters were ligated to cDNA with T4 DNA ligase and the products were amplified under the following thermocycler conditions: an initial denaturing step at 98°C for 30 seconds, followed by 14 cycles at 98°C for 30 seconds, 65°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 30 seconds. Final products of 100–300 bp were size-selected from agarose and sequenced on an Illumina Genome Analyzer by the Institute for Genome Sciences, University of Maryland, Baltimore.</p>
<p>Equivalently prepared cDNA from the “CCD+” pool was sequenced using a paired-end strategy with a 350-bp fragment size. A paired-end approach facilitates the assembly of longer contigs, and therefore may provide more diagnostic sequences for annotation, but at a cost of reduced read length (67 bp). Both sequencing runs were quality-trimmed by retaining only the longest contiguous sequence of each read with a minimum (Phred-equivalent) quality score of 15, excepting at most one ambiguous base. Reads less than 50 bp after this trimming step were discarded. A small number of reads were removed because they matched Illumina primer sequence in the Univec database (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/VecScreen/UniVec.html"">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/VecScreen/UniVec.html</a>).</p>
<p>Reads were assembled into contigs using the Velvet assembly package [24]. CCD− reads were assembled into contigs using multiple iterations of Velvet with successive hash lengths of 21, 31, 41, 51, or 61. Contigs of less than 100 bp or with less than 3X coverage were discarded. This assembly strategy was chosen to accommodate the broad spectrum of RNA sources in the sample (viruses, a diverse bacterial community, and eukaryotic pathogens as well as the host genome) that are likely to have different optimal hash lengths for assembly. CCD+ reads were assembled in a similar fashion without read-pair information; in addition, a single paired-end assembly was performed with Velvet using a hash length of 21 and an expected fragment length of 350. Contigs from all intermediate assemblies were then merged using the BlastClust component of Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) at 98% identity and 90% nonreciprocal overlap. Because there was substantial redundancy of contigs remaining after this step, we input the contigs to CAP3 [25] for more aggressive assembly, requiring a 60-bp overlap with 92% identity. Raw reads are available as accessions SRX028143 and SRX028145 of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive, however, the resulting contigs were not submitted because of an NCBI policy against hosting assemblies from mixed sources.</p>

The study was conducted during the Fall of 2020 with continued data analysis thru September 2021. Plastic contamination is the most pressing issue for the U.S. cotton industry today. Due to this problem, U.S. cotton has lost the 7 cents per pound premium it brought on international cotton markets. Plastic contaminants are often introduced prior to ginning, but cotton gin machinery can tear and shred the plastics so that they become more difficult to remove.

Data from: Phased Genotyping-by-Sequencing Enhances Analysis of Genetic Diversity and Reveals Divergent Copy Number Variants in Maize,"<p>High-throughput sequencing (HTS) of reduced representation genomic libraries has ushered in an era of genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), where genome-wide genotype data can be obtained for nearly any species. However, there remains a need for imputation-free GBS methods for genotyping large samples taken from heterogeneous populations of heterozygous individuals. This requires that a number of issues encountered with GBS be considered, including the sequencing of nonoverlapping sets of loci across multiple GBS libraries, a common missing data problem that results in low call rates for markers per individual, and a tendency for applicability only in inbred line samples with sufficient linkage disequilibrium for accurate imputation. We addressed these issues while developing and validating a new, comprehensive platform for GBS. This study supports the notion that GBS can be tailored to particular aims, and using <em>Zea mays</em> our results indicate that large samples of unknown pedigree can be genotyped to obtain complete and accurate GBS data. Optimizing size selection to sequence a high proportion of shared loci among individuals in different libraries and using simple in silico filters, a GBS procedure was established that produces high call rates per marker (&gt;85%) with accuracy exceeding 99.4%. Furthermore, by capitalizing on the sequence-read structure of GBS data (stacks of reads), a new tool for resolving local haplotypes and scoring phased genotypes was developed, a feature that is not available in many GBS pipelines. Using local haplotypes reduces the marker dimensionality of the genotype matrix while increasing the informativeness of the data. Phased GBS in maize also revealed the existence of reproducibly inaccurate (apparent accuracy) genotypes that were due to divergent copy number variants (CNVs) unobservable in the underlying single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data.</p>

Data from: Phenotypic and nodule microbial diversity among crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) accessions,"<p>Phenotypic evaluation of 37 crimson clover (<em>Trifolium incarnatum</em> L.) accessions from the US National Plant Germplasm System. Focus of the trial was on traits important for cover crop performance, including fall emergence, winter survival, flowering time, biomass, nitrogen (N) content in aboveground biomass, and proportion of plant N from biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). Experiments were conducted at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (Maryland, USA) across three growing seasons (2012-2013, 2013-2014, 2014-2015).</p>
<p>The field design was a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replications in each year, except for five accessions planted in 2015, which only had three replications due to limited seed availability. Each plot was a single row 0.6 m in length and 1.5 m between plots. Between 37 and 45 seeds were planted per plot, depending on seed availability in each year.</p>
<p>Fall emergence was evaluated in late October of each year by counting the total number of plants in each plot. Winter survival was determined by counting total number of plants per plot in late April divided by the total number of plants counted in the fall.</p>
<p>Flowering time was evaluated by recording percent flowering on a per-plot basis on a scale from 0% (no flower buds present) to 100% (all flowers dried up entire length of head). Flowering evaluations took place periodically between late April and early June. In 2013, evaluation took place on six dates: 23 Apr., 9 May, 15 May, 24 May, 30 May, and 4 June. In 2014, evaluation took place on five dates: 28 Apr., 6 May, 13 May, 19 May, and 27 May. In 2015, evaluation took place on eight dates: 25 Apr., 29 Apr., 4 May, 7 May, 11 May, 14 May, 18 May, and 21 May. Frequency of evaluations and total duration of evaluation period varied from year-to-year primarily due to the effects of year-to-year weather variation on the rate of growth and development.</p>
<p>Once an accession was rated at 50% or greater for flowering, biomass was collected. All plants in the plot were pulled up with roots attached. Plants were counted and the roots were clipped. All plants within a plot were placed in the same brown paper bag and dried. Dry weight was recorded and plants were ground for laboratory evaluation of nitrogen content, proportion of nitrogen from BNF, and metagenomic analysis.</p>
<p>The crimson clover biomass samples were separated into shoots and roots. Shoots were oven dried (60 °C) for approximately 72 h, weighed, and ground to pass a 1.0-mm screen. Tissue C and N concentrations and 15N natural abundance were determined for the shoot material of each accession using a Thermo Delta V Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and Carlo Erba NC2500 Elemental Analyzer (Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy). Isotopic abundance data were expressed as δ15N in parts per thousand (‰), representing the abundance of plant tissue 15N relative to that of atmospheric N2.</p>

Data from: Plant strategies for maximizing growth during drought and drought recovery in Solanum melongena L. (eggplant),"<p>Data usage: This data represents the collection of physiological and biometric data of above- and below-ground plant traits in four species of <em>Solanum</em> <em>melongena</em> of Philippine origin (PHL 4841, PHL 2778, PHL 2789, and Mara). Half of the plants were subjected to significant water deficit, and half again of those deficit plants were allowed to recover after subsequent watering. This data is suitable to serve as a benchmark for trait values in <em>S. melongena</em>, as well as in studies of trait responses to terminal drought and episodic drought in agricultural settings. Traits in this dataset include Leaf Water Potential, total leaf area (cm2), Leaf Canopy temp, Fv/Fm, Photosynthesis, Stomatal Conductance, Transpiration Rate, Water Use Efficiency, Green Leaf Dry Weight, Senesced Leaf Dry Weight, Stem Dry Weight, Total Shoot Dry Weight, Leaf Area Ratio, Specific Leaf Area, Specific Leaf Weight, Basal Fine Root Mass, Total Fine Root Mass, Coarse Roots Mass, Total Root Mass, Root:Shoot Ratio, Total Fine Root length (cm), Total Fine Root Surface Area (m2), Total Fine Root Volume (m3), Specific fine root length (m/g), Root tissue density (g/m3), Fine root length:Leaf area Ratio (cm/çm2), and root mass fraction.</p>
<p>Methods and materials:<br />
A greenhouse experiment was set up to identify physiological traits associated with drought tolerance in eggplant. Solanum melongena genotypes PHL 4841, PHL 2778 and PHL 2789 were chosen based on drought performance in previous field and greenhouse trials (58) of 100 germplasm accessions from the National Plant Genetic Resources Laboratory in the Institute of Plant Breeding, University of the Philippines at Los Baños, Laguna, Philippines. S. melongena ‘Mara’, a released variety from the Institute of Plant Breeding, UP Los Baños was included as a reference variety. Seeds were sown into seedling trays containing fritted clay (Turface Greens Grade, Profile Products, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) at the end of February in a greenhouse in Fort Collins, CO. After 17-21 days seedlings were transplanted into 7.57 L plastic pots containing 10 kg fritted clay and watered to holding capacity via a drip irrigation before treatments were established. Pots were positioned on two greenhouse benches in a randomized complete block design of two factors: water availability (drought vs. well-watered control) and genotype (four genotypes). There were 5 replicates of each block (40 plants). This basic block design was doubled, and plants were harvested at 2 time points (post-drought and post-recovery) for a total of 80 plants.<br />
Plants were maintained under a combination of natural sunlight and supplemental LED illumination on a 14:10 hour day:night cycle, corresponding to average temperatures of 22 and 29˚C. Plants were fertigated using Grow More water soluble fertilizer (Grow More, Inc., Gardena, CA) amended with additional N in the form of urea and additional K in the form of KH2PO4 to achieve 79.5-22.5-5 ppm N:P:K daily for the first month after transplantation and transitioned to 60-30-120 ppm N:P:K for the remainder of the experiment.<br />
Drought treatments began at 5 weeks after transplanting and lasted for 2 weeks for all blocks (80 plants). “Drought” plants received 30% of evapotranspiration (ET) of “control” plants daily for the first week, and 10% daily in the second week. “Control” plants were given 100% of ET daily. ET was calculated by weighing control pots daily at 1400 hr to measure evaporative and transpiration water loss relative to 100% holding capacity. After the conclusion of the drought treatment, all remaining plants were re-watered to pot holding capacity.<br />
Physiological measurements<br />
Randomized measurements of drought and control plants were carried out from the 11th through the 15th and final day of the drought treatment on 50% of the experimental plant population. On each day, the third fully expanded leaf of each plant was measured for chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) from 07:30 until 08:30 using a portable OS5P fluorometer (Opti-Sciences Inc., NH, USA).  Each leaf was dark acclimated with leaf clips for 20 minutes prior to measurement. From 09:00 to 12:00 hrs, the same leaves were measured for photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and transpiration using the Li-COR 6400XT infrared gas analyzer with attached leaf measurement chamber (LiCOR Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska).  Conditions in the leaf measurement chamber were the following: PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) of 1800 µmol m-2s-1, leaf temperature of 25˚C, and CO2 concentration of 400 µmol mol-1. Instantaneous water use efficiency (WUEi) was calculated as the ratio of photosynthesis (An) to stomatal conductance (gs).<br />
Leaf water potential (ΨL) was determined with use of a Scholander pressure chamber (Soil Moisture Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The same leaf used for gas exchange measurements was cut from each plant and immediately placed in a plastic bag in a cooler until ΨL could be measured (up to 1 hour).<br />
After one week under full watering, “recovered” and control plants were again measured as above for chlorophyll fluorescence and leaf water potential.<br />
Plant growth measurements<br />
Following physiological measurements, the aboveground portions of drought and control plants were cut and partitioned into leaves and stem. Total leaf area was measured for each plant using a Li-3100C leaf area meter (LiCOR Inc., USA). Partitioned shoot tissue was then oven dried at 60˚C for 48 hours and weighed.<br />
The belowground biomass of each plant was washed free of fritted clay and partitioned into fine and coarse roots. A representative sample of fine roots was obtained for each sample and stored in 30% ethyl alcohol for root scanning. Preserved fine roots were scanned in water in 2-D transparency mode with a desktop scanner (EpsonV750, Epson America Inc., USA) and analyzed using WinRHIZOTM software (Regent Instruments Inc., Canada). Remaining fine and coarse roots were dried and weighed as above. Leaf area ratio (total leaf area per total plant dry mass, m2 g-1; LAR) and specific leaf area (leaf area per leaf dry mass, m2 g-1; SLA), and leaf mass area (leaf dry mass per leaf area, g m-2; LMA) were calculated using the leaf data for each plant. Specific root length of fine roots (root length per dry mass, m g-1; SRLFineRts) and total root mass fraction (RMF, total root mass per total plant weight) were calculated using the fine root length and root biomass data from each plant (31,59)<br />
At the end of the recovery phase, all plants were also destructively sampled for measurement of leaf area and above- and below-ground biomass partitioning as above.</p>

Data from: Ploidy determination of buffel grass accessions in the USDA National Plant Germplasm System collection by flow cytometry,"<p>Buffel grass (<em>Cenchrus ciliaris</em> L. syn. <em>Pennisetum ciliare</em> (L.) Link) is an economically important warm-season perennial used primarily as a forage and range grass in many of the drier regions throughout the subtropics and tropics. Because buffel grass has excellent drought tolerance combined with desirable forage traits, it is an important forage and range grass in parts of Africa, including South Africa. It was introduced into many of the arid subtropical regions of the world, primarily Australia, North America, and South America, and today the species is grown on more than 50 million ha worldwide. Knowledge of the ploidy, meiotic behavior, and fertility of the plants used in hybridization programs became important because success depended upon using meiotically stable parental lines with compatible chromosome numbers. Little is known about the chromosome number of the buffel grass accessions in the USDA National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) because the species has small chromosomes, that makes them difficult to count using traditional cytological methods. The DNA content of 568 accessions of buffel grass in the USDA National Plant Germplasm System was determined through flow cytometry to predict their ploidy levels. Based on DNA content, 308 accessions were determined as tetraploids with 36 chromosomes, 139 as pentaploids with 45 chromosomes, 20 as hexaploids with 54 chromosomes, two as septaploids with 63 chromosomes, and 99 as aneuploids. Chromosome counts of selected plants confirmed ploidy levels from DNA findings. Chromosome number of euploid plants could be predicted from the DNA data.</p>
<p>The findings from this investigation reveal that the accessions in the buffel grass collection consist of a wide range of cytotypes, including polyploids and aneuploids with varying chromosome numbers. This demonstrates the amount of chromosomal diversity that occurs within the species and this collection. Grass breeders who use the buffel grass germplasm in the NPGS in their breeding programs should ensure that they know the chromosome number of the material requested. The predicted ploidy levels in Supplementary Table 1 will provide that information to the breeders.</p>

"Data from: Population growth of native and invasive strains of the larger grain borer, Prostephanus truncatus on three maize hybrids","<p><strong>Insects</strong><br />
Two different populations of <em>Prostephanus truncatus</em> were used in the bioassays, one originated from the invaded range in Ghana, and the other from the native range in Mexico. Both populations were maintained in the Laboratory of Entomology and Agricultural Zoology (LEAZ), at the Department of Agriculture, Crop Production and Rural Environment, University of Thessaly, Greece, on whole maize kernels, at 26°C and 55% relative humidity (RH) and continuous darkness.<br />
<strong>European Maize Hybrids</strong><br />
Three different maize hybrids (“PICO”, “HAMILTON”, and “AGN 672”) were obtained from American Genetics SA, Sindos, Greece. All hybrids were cultivated at Serres, in northern Greece according to the local farming practices. The hybrid “PICO” has a great production potential and it is adapted to multiple soil types and can produce high-weight grain. The hybrid “HAMILTON” is a dual-purpose hybrid, that has excellent early vigor and it is tolerant to fungi, and the hybrid “AGN 672” has excellent early vigor and it is also tolerant to fungi.<br />
<strong>Population Growth on Different Maize Hybrids</strong><br />
Three different maize hybrids (PICO, Hamilton, and AGN 672) were used for experimentation. These hybrids were untreated and uninfested, and kept at ambient conditions until the beginning of the experiments. Before proceeding with the bioassays, grain moisture content (M.C.) was assessed, using a moisture meter (mini-GAC plus, Dickey-John Europe S.A.S., Colombes, France). Standardized plastic vials as in prior work (Quellhorst et al. 2023; Lampiri et al. 2022) were used here (3 cm in diameter, 8 cm in height). Vials were then filled with 20 g of one of the three maize hybrids with lids added after. The commodity was weighed with a Precisa XB3200D compact balance (Alpha Analytical Instruments, Gerakas, Greece). The upper rings of the vials were treated with Fluon (Northern Products Inc., Woonsocket, USA) to prevent insects from moving away from the grain and/or escaping. The top of each vial also had small holes punched to allow ventilation. Each vial then received 10 <em>P. truncatus</em> adults of mixed sex and age from one of two different strains. Two different populations of <em>P. truncatus</em> were used as mentioned above. The vials were placed inside incubators set at 30°C and 65% R.H. in continuous darkness. The vials were removed from the incubators after 45 d and adult progeny production was recorded. We also recorded the weight of frass, the number of insect-damaged kernels (IDK), and the total weight of the kernels within each vial. For each combination, i.e. hybrid × strain, there were n = 9 replicates.</p>

Data from: Porcine intestinal innate lymphoid cells and lymphocyte spatial context revealed through single-cell RNA sequencing,"<p>Files pertaining to data analyses performed and presented in the preprint, 'Porcine intestinal innate lymphoid cells and lymphocyte spatial context revealed through single-cell RNA sequencing' by Wiarda et al. 2022 are provided in this dataset. Single cell suspensions enriched for lymphocytes were obtained from ileum of two seven-week-old pigs and subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected and processed for scRNA-seq in parallel. scRNA-seq was performed to provide transcriptomic profiles of lymphocytes in porcine ileum, with 31,983 cells annotated into 26 cell types. Deeper interrogation of data revealed previously undescribed cells in porcine intestine, including <em>SELL</em>hi γδ T cells, group 1 and group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), and four subsets of B cells. Single-cell transcriptomes in ileum were compared to those in porcine blood, and subsets of activated lymphocytes were detected in ileum but not periphery. Comparison to scRNA-seq human and murine ileum data revealed a general consensus of ileal lymphocytes across species. Lymphocyte spatial context in porcine ileum was conferred through differential tissue dissection prior to scRNA-seq. Antibody-secreting cells, B cells, follicular CD4 αβ T cells, and cycling T/ILCs were enriched in ileum with Peyer’s patches, while non-cycling γδ T, CD8 αβ T, and group 1 ILCs were enriched in ileum without Peyer’s patches.

<p>Purpose<br />
This study aims to investigate the consequences of performing precipitation manipulation experiments with mineralized water in place of rainwater (i.e. demineralized water).  Limited attention has been paid to the effects of water mineralization on plant and soil properties, even when the experiments are in a rainfed context.</p>
<p>Methods<br />
We conducted a 6-yr experiment with a gradient in spring rainfall (70, 100, and 130% of ambient).  We tested effects of rainfall treatments on plant biomass and six soil properties and interpreted the confounding effects of dissolved solids in irrigation water.</p>
<p>Results<br />
Rainfall treatments affected all response variables.  Sulfate was the most common dissolved solid in irrigation water and was 41 times more abundant in irrigated (i.e. 130% of ambient) than other plots.  Soils of irrigated plots also had elevated iron (16.5 µg × 10 cm-2 × 60-d vs 8.9) and pH (7.0 vs 6.8).  The rainfall gradient also had a nonlinear (hump-shaped) effect on plant available phosphorus (P).  Plant and microbial biomasses are often limited by and positively associated with available P, suggesting the predicted positive linear relationship between plant biomass and P was confounded by additions of mineralized water.  In other words, the unexpected nonlinear relationship was likely driven by components of mineralized irrigation water (i.e. calcium, iron) and/or shifts in soil pH that immobilized P.</p>
<p>Conclusions<br />
Our results suggest robust precipitation manipulation experiments should either capture rainwater when possible (or use demineralized water) or consider the confounding effects of mineralized water on plant and soil properties.</p>

Data from: Proteomics analysis reveals novel host molecular mechanisms associated with thermotherapy of 'Ca. Liberibacter asiaticus'-infected citrus plants,"<p>Background<br />
Citrus Huanglongbing (HLB), which is linked to the bacterial <em>Candidatus</em> pathogen '<em>Ca.</em> Liberibacter asiaticus' (Las), is the most devastating disease of citrus plants, and longer-term control measures via breeding or genetic engineering have been unwieldy because all cultivated citrus species are susceptible to the disease. However, the degree of susceptibility varies among citrus species, which has prompted efforts to identify potential Las resistance/tolerance-related genes in citrus plants for application in breeding or genetic engineering programs. Plant exposure to one form of stress has been shown to serendipitously induce innate resistance to other forms of stress and a recent study showed that continuous heat treatment (40 to 42 °C) reduced Las titer and HLB-associated symptoms in citrus seedlings. The goal of the present study was to apply comparative proteomics analysis via 2-DE and mass spectrometry to elucidate the molecular processes associated with heat-induced mitigation of HLB in citrus plants. Healthy or Las-infected citrus grapefruit plants were exposed to room temperature or to continuous heat treatment of 40 °C for 6 days.</p>
<p>Results<br />
An exhaustive total protein extraction process facilitated the identification of 107 differentially-expressed proteins in response to Las and/or heat treatment, which included a strong up-regulation of chaperones including small (23.6, 18.5 and 17.9 kDa) heat shock proteins, a HSP70-like protein and a ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (RuBisCO)-binding 60 kDa chaperonin, particularly in response to heat treatment. Other proteins that were generally down-regulated due to Las infection but up-regulated in response to heat treatment include RuBisCO activase, chlorophyll a/b binding protein, glucosidase II beta subunit-like protein, a putative lipoxygenase protein, a ferritin-like protein, and a glutathione S-transferase.</p>
<p>Conclusions<br />
The differentially-expressed proteins identified in this study highlights a premier characterization of the molecular mechanisms potentially involved in the reversal of Las-induced pathogenicity processes in citrus plants and are hence proposed targets for application towards the development of cisgenic Las-resistant/tolerant citrus plants.</p>

"Data from: Pyrosequencing-Based Analysis of the Microbiome Associated with the Horn Fly, Haematobia irritans","<p>The bacterial 16S tag-encoded FLX-titanium amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) method was used to carry out the classification analysis of bacterial flora in adult female and male horn flies and horn fly eggs.</p>
<p>The bTEFAP method identified 16S rDNA sequences in our samples which allowed the identification of various prokaryotic taxa associated with the life stage examined. This is the first comprehensive report of bacterial flora associated with the horn fly using a culture-independent method. Several rumen, environmental, symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria associated with the horn fly were identified and quantified. This is the first report of the presence of Wolbachia in horn flies of USA origin and is the first report of the presence of Rikenella in an obligatory blood feeding insect.</p>
<p>Adult horn flies were collected on a single date from pastured cattle at the Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, St. Gabriel Research Station using aerial nets. Within 1 h after collection the flies were transferred to large sterile Erlenmeyer flasks and maintained in total darkness for 1.5 h and 30°C to allow flies to oviposit on the flask bottom [73]. Adult flies were released from the flasks into a cage and eggs were collected by rinsing with distilled water onto a filter paper. Both the eggs and adult flies were frozen at −80°C. To preserve nucleic acid integrity, adults were sexed on dry ice prior to freezing. Each sample used for DNA extraction and pyrosequencing consisted of 5 adult males, 5 adult females or 50 eggs pooled together and homogenized. Three replicates of adult male, adult female and eggs were analyzed.</p>
<p>The horn fly, Haematobia irritans, is one of the most economically important pests of cattle. Insecticides have been a major element of horn fly management programs. Growing concerns with insecticide resistance, insecticide residues on farm products, and non-availability of new generation insecticides, are serious issues for the livestock industry. Alternative horn fly control methods offer the promise to decrease the use of insecticides and reduce the amount of insecticide residues on livestock products and give an impetus to the organic livestock farming segment. The horn fly, an obligatory blood feeder, requires the help of microflora to supply additional nutrients and metabolize the blood meal. Recent advancements in DNA sequencing methodologies enable researchers to examine the microflora diversity independent of culture methods.</p>

The dataset contains 15-minute mean weather data from the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU) research weather station, Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL) for all days in 2016. The data are from sensors deployed at standard heights over grass that is irrigated and mowed during the growing season to reference evapotranspiration standards. Sensors are duplicated at each height, and data from a duplicate sensor may be used to fill gaps in data from the primary sensor using appropriate regression relationships. Gap filling may also be accomplished using sensors deployed at one of the four large weighing lysimeters immediately west of the weather station. The primary paper describes details of the sensors used and methods of testing, calibration and use. The weather data include air temperature (C) and relative humidity (%), wind speed (m/s), solar irradiance (W m-2) and precipitation. Because the large (3 m by 3 m surface area) weighing lysimeters are better rain gages than are tipping bucket gages, the 15-minute precipitation data are derived for each lysimeter from changes in lysimeter mass. The land slope is &lt;1% and flat. The mean annual precipitation is ~470 mm, the 20-year pan evaporation record indicates ~2,600 mm Class A pan evaporation per year, and winds are typically from the South and Southwest. The climate is semi-arid with ~70% (350 mm) of the annual precipitation occurring from May to September, during which period the pan evaporation averages ~1520 mm.</p>

"Data from: Range size, local abundance and effect inform species descriptions at scales relevant for local conservation practice","<p>Understanding species abundances and distributions, especially at local to landscape scales, is critical for land managers and conservationists to prioritize management decisions and informs the effort and expense that may be required. The metrics of range size and local abundance reflect aspects of the biology and ecology of a given species, and together with its per capita (or per unit area) effects on other members of the community comprise a well-accepted theoretical paradigm describing invasive species. Although these metrics are readily calculated from vegetation monitoring data, they have not generally (and effect in particular) been applied to native species. We describe how metrics defining invasions may be more broadly applied to both native and invasive species in vegetation management, supporting their relevance to local scales of species conservation and management. We then use a sample monitoring dataset to compare range size, local abundance and effect as well as summary calculations of landscape penetration (range size × local abundance) and impact (landscape penetration × effect) for native and invasive species in the mixed-grass plant community of western North Dakota, USA. This paper uses these summary statistics to quantify the impact for 13 of 56 commonly encountered species, with statistical support for effects of 6 of the 13 species. Our results agree with knowledge of invasion severity and natural history of native species in the region. We contend that when managers are using invasion metrics in monitoring, extending them to common native species is biologically and ecologically informative, with little additional investment.</p>

"Data from: Response to selection for parasitism of a sub-optimal, low-preference host in an aphid parasitoid","<p>Risks of post-introduction evolution in insects introduced to control invasive pests have been discussed for some time, but little is known about responses to selection or genetic architectures of host adaptation and thus about the likelihood or rapidity of evolutionary shifts. We report here results on the response to selection and genetic architecture of parasitism of a sub-optimal, low-preference host species by an aphid parasitoid, <em>Aphelinus rhamni</em>, a candidate for introduction against the soybean aphid, <em>Aphis glycines</em>. The parasitoid was collected in Beijing, China, from the soybean aphid on a Rhamnus species. In the laboratory at the USDA-ARS, Newark, Delaware, we selected <em>A. rhamni</em> for increased parasitism of <em>Rhopalsiphum padi</em> by rearing the parasitoid on this aphid for three generations. We measured parasitism of <em>R. padi</em> at generations two and three, and at generation three, crossed and backcrossed parasitoids from the populations reared on <em>R. padi</em> with those from populations reared on <em>Aphis glycines</em> and compared parasitism of both <em>R. padi</em> and <em>Aphis glycines</em> among F1 and backcross females. <em>Aphelinus rhamni</em> responded rapidly to selection for parasitism of <em>R. padi</em>. Selection for <em>R. padi</em> parasitism reduced parasitism of <em>Aphis glycines</em>, the original host of <em>A. rhamni</em>. However, parasitism of <em>R. padi</em> did not increase from generation two to generation three of selection, suggesting reduced variance available for selection, which was indeed found. We tested the associations between 184 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and increased parasitism of <em>R. padi</em> and found 28 SNP loci, some of which were associated with increased and others with decreased parasitism of <em>R. padi</em>. We assembled and annotated the <em>A. rhamni</em> genome, mapped all SNP loci to contigs, and tested whether genes on contigs with SNP loci associated with parasitism were enriched for candidate genes or gene functions. We identified 80 genes on these contigs that mapped to 1.2 Mb of the 483 Mb genome of <em>A. rhamni</em> but found little enrichment of candidate genes or gene functions.</p>

"Data from: Retention of Pantoea agglomerans Sc1R across stadia of the southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae)","<p>Southern green stink bug [<em>Nezara viridula</em> (L.)] adults and other pentatomid pests can transmit pathogens (e.g., the bacterium <em>Pantoea agglomerans</em>) that cause disease in cotton (<em>Gossypium hirsutum</em> L.) and other high-value cash crops worldwide. First instars of <em>N. viridula</em> were recently shown to ingest <em>P. agglomerans</em> strain Sc1R with rifampicin-resistance, and to retain the pathogen to the 2nd instar. The objective of this study was to determine the acquisition of <em>P. agglomerans</em> Sc1R by early instars of <em>N. viridula</em> and determine persistence of <em>P. agglomerans</em> Sc1R across subsequent stadia. In three trials, early instars (1st and 2nd) were exposed to <em>P. agglomerans</em> Sc1R and subsequently maintained to adulthood; cohorts were sampled at 3rd and 5th instars, as well as adults. In every trial, <em>P. agglomerans</em> Sc1R was detected in all stadia, including adults, but significantly higher frequencies of infection than expected were observed at the initial stage of infection (either 1st or 2nd instar). Higher densities of <em>P. agglomerans</em> Sc1R were detected in 1st and 2nd instars, and lower densities were observed in subsequent stadia. Densities of innate bacterial flora were generally lower when the initial stage of exposure was at 1st instar than when the initial stage of exposure was at the 2nd instar. Overall, half of the adults possessed <em>P. agglomerans</em> Sc1R. These findings demonstrated that <em>N. viridula</em> nymphs can acquire <em>P. agglomerans</em> Sc1R and retain the pathogen to adulthood. Potential avenues of research to further elucidate the implications of nymphs harboring pathogens to adulthood are discussed.</p>

Data from: Retrospective Analysis of a Classical Biological Control Program,"<p>Life Table Data: Field-based, partial life table data for immature stages of <em>Bemisia tabaci</em> on cotton in Maricopa, Arizona, USA. Data were generated on approximately 200 individual insects per cohort with 2-5 cohorts per year for a total of 44 cohorts between 1997 and 2010. Data provide the marginal, stage-specific rates of mortality for eggs, and 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th instar nymphs.  Mortality is characterized as caused by inviability (eggs only), dislodgement, predation, parasitism and unknown. Detailed methods can be found in Naranjo and Ellsworth 2005 (<em>Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata</em> 116(2): 93-108).  The method takes advantage of the sessile nature of immature stages of this insect. Briefly, an observer follows individual eggs or settled first instar nymphs from natural populations on the underside of cotton leaves in the field with a hand lens and determines causes of death for each individual over time.  Approximately 200 individual eggs and nymphs are observed for each cohort. Separately, densities of eggs and nymphs are monitored with standard methods (Naranjo and Flint 1994, <em>Environmental Entomology</em> 23: 254-266; Naranjo and Flint 1995, <em>Environmental Entomology</em> 24: 261-270) on a weekly basis.</p>

Data from: Selenium geochemistry in reclaimed phosphate mine soils and its relationship with plant bioavailability,"Selenium accumulation in vegetation has resulted in toxicity in livestock grazing on phosphate mine soils in Southeastern Idaho. Plant and soil samples were collected from sites located near phosphate mines. Soil physicochemical properties, Se speciation, and Se distribution from a sequential extraction procedure (SEP) were examined in relation to bioavailability in the Se-hyperaccumulator, western aster (<em>Symphyotrichum ascendens</em> Lindl.). Selenium-hyperaccumulators are plants that can absorb over 1000 mg Se kg−1 DM (Dry Matter). Chemical analyses revealed that western aster contained Se exceeding 6000 mg kg−1 DM. Soil speciation results indicated that selenite (SeO32−) was dominant with lower levels of selenate (SeO42−) present. This was expanded using an SEP that accounted for six fractions. Regression analyses indicated a strong relationship for western aster Se and the water-soluble and phosphate-extractable SEP fractions combined (R2 = 0.85). Once carbonate, amorphous Fe-oxide, organic, and residual Se fractions were factored into the analysis, the relationship decreased. A strong relationship between selenate and the water-soluble Se fraction was also observed (R2 = 0.83). Soluble and phosphate-extractable Se were determined to be ""bioavailable fractions"" for western aster. Thus, simple water extractions can be used for quick assessment of Se bioavailability and provide a means to identify potentially hazardous areas locations.",Agricultural Research Service,"Favorito, Jessica E.",mailto:jfavorit@vt.edu,2022-09-27,https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1007%2Fs11104-017-3299-5/MediaObjects/11104_2017_3299_MOESM1_ESM.docx,text/html,public
"Data from: Shoot transcriptome of the giant reed, Arundo donax","<p>The giant reed, <em>Arundo donax</em>, is a perennial grass species that has become an invasive plant in many countries. Expansive stands of <em>A. donax</em> have significant negative impacts on available water resources and efforts are underway to identify biological control agents against this species. The giant reed grows under adverse environmental conditions, displaying insensitivity to drought stress, flooding, heavy metals, salinity and herbaceous competition, thus hampering control programs. To establish a foundational molecular dataset, we used an llumina Hi-Seq protocol to sequence the transcriptome of actively growing shoots from an invasive genotype collected along the Rio Grande River, bordering Texas and Mexico. We report the assembly of 27,491 high confidence transcripts (≥200 bp) with at least 70% coverage of known genes in other Poaceae species. Of these 13,080 (47.58%), 6165 (22.43%) and 8246 (30.0%) transcripts have sequence similarity to known, domain-containing and conserved hypothetical proteins, respectively. We also report 75,590 low confidence transcripts supported by both trans-ABBySS and Velvet-Oases <em>de novo</em> assembly pipelines. Within the low confidence subset of transcripts we identified partial hits to known (19,021; 25.16%), domain-containing (7093; 9.38%) and conserved hypothetical (16,647; 22.02%) proteins. Additionally 32,829 (43.43%) transcripts encode putative hypothetical proteins unique to A. donax. Functional annotation resulted in 5,550 and 6,070 transcripts with assigned Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway information, respectively. The most abundant KEGG pathways are spliceosome, ribosome, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, plant–pathogen interaction, RNA degradation and oxidative phosphorylation metabolic pathway. Furthermore, we also found 12, 9, and 4 transcripts annotated as stress-related, heat stress, and water stress proteins, respectively. It is envisaged that these resources will promote and facilitate studies of the abiotic stress capabilities of this exotic plant species, which facilitates its invasive capacity. Supplemental Excel data files with the article detail functional annotation of Arundo donax high confidence and low confidence genes.

Data from: Similarities among Test Sites Based on the Performance of Advanced Breeding Lines in the Great Plains Hard Winter Wheat Region,"<p>USDA-ARS coordinated regional wheat (<em>Triticum aestivum</em> L.) breeding trials examine agronomic performance and adaptation over a wider geographic range than single breeding programs can achieve. The trials provide an evaluation of experimental breeding lines in alternate test sites that are environmentally similar or dissimilar to the program of origin. Data from USDA-ARS Hard Winter Wheat Regional Nurseries grown in 1987 to 2014 were used to identify similarities among Great Plains test sites. Mean correlations of entry grain yields across locations and years were used in principal factor analyses to cluster them into production zones. The procedures used were identical to those of a previously published analysis using test data from 1959 to 1989. Five factors explained 67% of the variance in the correlation matrix among Southern Regional Performance Nursery (SRPN) locations. The analysis divided the SRPN into four major Great Plains production zones, designated Southeast, Northwest, Southwest and Northeast. The remaining minor production zone consisted of only two central South Dakota locations, both outside the typical target area and selection site of SRPN entries. In the Northern Regional Performance Nursery (NRPN), five production zones were established, with location separation predominantly resulting from east–west differences in performance. The SRPN and NRPN wheat production zones closely follow previously described ecological zones of adaptation of native Great Plains plant species. Wheat breeding programs and growers may continue to use the production zones established via the USDA-ARS coordinated winter wheat regional nurseries to target and select germplasm for crossing and for production.</p>

Data from: Soil carbon and nitrogen data during eight years of cover crop and compost treatments in organic vegetable production,"<p>Data presented are on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) inputs, and changes in soil C and N in eight systems during the first eight years of a tillage-intensive organic vegetable systems study that was focused on romaine lettuce and broccoli production in Salinas Valley on the central coast region of California. The eight systems differed in organic matter inputs from cover crops and urban yard-waste compost. The cover crops included cereal rye, a legume-rye mixture, and a mustard mixture planted at two seeding rates (standard rate 1x versus high rate 3x). There were three legume-rye 3x systems that differed in compost inputs (0 versus 7.6 Mg ha−1 vegetable crop−1) and cover cropping frequency (every winter versus every fourth winter). The data include: (1) changes in soil total organic C and total N concentrations and stocks and nitrate N (NO3-N) concentrations over 8 years, (2) cumulative above ground and estimated below ground C and N inputs, cover crop and crop N uptake, and harvested crop N export over 8 years, (3) soil permanganate oxidizable carbon (POX-C) concentrations and stocks at time 0, 6 and 8 years, and (4) cumulative, estimated yields of lettuce and broccoli (using total biomass and harvest index values) over the 8 years. The C inputs from the vegetables and cover crops included estimates of below ground inputs based on shoot biomass and literature values for shoot:root. The data in this article support and augment information presented in the <em>PLoS ONE</em> research article “Winter cover crops increase readily decomposable soil carbon, but compost drives total soil carbon during eight years of intensive, organic vegetable production in California”.</p>

Data from: Soil resistance under grazed intermediate wheatgrass,"<p>Intermediate wheatgrass [Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkw. & D.R. Dewey subsp. intermedium] is a high-yielding cool-season grass with adaptable uses for grazing, haying, and soil restoration. Despite its adaptability, adoption of intermediate wheatgrass has been limited due to inadequate stand longevity under grazing stress. A study was conducted near Mandan, ND USA to investigate if stand longevity of intermediate wheatgrass was affected by changes in soil properties due to grazing. Soil data from this study included measurements of soil bulk density, soil pH, soil organic carbon, and total soil nitrogen on a Wilton silt loam soil (USDA: Fine-silty, mixed, superactive frigid Pachic Haplustoll). Measurements were made in May 1997 (baseline) and again in May 2004 following four years of grazing. Data may be used to understand soil property responses to grazed perennial forages. Data are generally applicable to rainfed conditions under a semiarid Continental climate for the following associated soil types: Temvik, Grassna, Linton, Mandan, and Williams.</p>

Data from: Steroidal saponin concentrations in switchgrass cultivars Liberty and Independence in North America,"<p>Switchgrass (<em>Panicum virgatum</em> L.) is a warm-season grass native to the tallgrass prairie in North America with various ecosystem benefits and enhance the resiliency of ecosystems. These resilient qualities of switchgrass may be due to the steroidal saponins produced by the grass. Steroidal saponins are plant secondary metabolites in the group of terpenes. Steroidal saponins are triterpenes that have antibacterial and antifungal characteristics. Switchgrass cultivars “Liberty” and “Independence” are two prominent bioenergy switchgrass cultivars for the Great Plains and Midwest. This dataset shows the relative steroidal saponin concentration in leaf and stem tissues from both Liberty and Independence switchgrass. The steroidal saponins, protodioscin, dichotomin, and saponin B, were detected in all leaf and stem tissues of both Liberty and Independence cultivars.</p>

"Data from: Switchgrass cultivar, yield, and nutrient removal responses to harvest timing","<p>Finite nutrients, such as P and K are assumedly remobilized post-senescence in herbaceous feedstocks like switchgrass (<em>Panicum virgatum</em> L.) as a function of environmental signaling and genotype. Harvesting early during the maturation phase may result in yield reductions and higher nutrient removal in biomass depending on ecotype. Therefore, it is necessary to target harvest dates that optimize yield while minimizing nutrient removal per cultivar. Consequently, objectives were to compare yields from 2010–2011 on eight widely used and experimental upland and lowland genotype (whole plot) at two locations in Tennessee, to determine: (i) which harvest timing (split-plot) provides maximum yield; (ii) effects of harvest timing (mid-September, October, November, and late October) on overall total P and K removal; and, (iii) how results are affected by cultivar. Among all post-senescence harvests, yields peaked early November (13.2 Mg ha–1), which was greater than all other harvests (P &lt; 0.05), with mid-October and late October not differing from one another. Because yields peaked in early November, P and K removal did not vary across harvest dates (despite both P and K concentrations declining mid-October). Lowland cultivars yielded 3.9 Mg ha–1 more biomass annually than upland entries, suggesting lowland cultivars are better suited to environments in the Southeast. Due to lower yields, P and K removals were lower for upland (Blackwell and C62), compared with lowland cultivars. Consequently, switchgrass can be harvested as early as mid-September without removing greater amounts of P and K, although variations within upland and lowland cultivars will likely occur.</p>

Data from: TaqMan-based duplex real-time PCR approach for analysis of grain composition (Zea mays - Sorghum bicolor) in feedstock flour mixes for bioethanol production,"<p>Some U.S bioethanol plants use a blend of maize and sorghum grains as feedstocks depending on availability and price. Knowledge of the grain composition of milled feedstock is beneficial for maximizing process efficiency and for potential future regulatory requirements. To analyze feedstock composition, we developed a duplex real-time PCR assay based on TaqMan™ probes for the simultaneous analysis of flour blends. For sorghum, the method amplified a sequence within the F-Box domain-containing protein and for maize, the method amplified a sequence of the high mobility group a (HMGa) proteins. To acquire fluorescent signals simultaneously, FAM and TAMRA fluorescent probes were used to label the sorghum- and maize- specific probes, respectively. Results showed that the primers and probes were highly specific either for maize or sorghum. The real-time duplex PCR assay was validated on simulated flour binary mixtures and high in the precision and accuracy for the sorghum PCR system. Results with the established method showed specificity and sensitivity in quantifying sorghum composition in bioethanol feedstock mixtures.</p>

"Data from: Temperature influences lipid content in the red harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus","<p>Data files for manuscript titled ""Temperature influences lipid content in the red harvester ant, <em>Pogonomyrmex barbatus</em>"".</p>
<p>Excel file with 3 tabs: Metadata, Monthly Lipid Content, and 10 Day Lipid Content. Metadata is contained within Excel file that describes all variables for each tab.</p>
<p>Abstract from paper:<br />
Temperature is one of the most important environmental conditions affecting physiological processes in ectothermic organisms like ants. Yet we often lack information on how certain physiological traits co-vary with temperature across time. Here, we test predictions on how one trait—lipid content—co-varies with temperature using a conspicuous, ground-dwelling harvester ant. We focus on lipid content as fat bodies are metabolically active tissues that are important for storing and releasing energy in response to demand, which could be vital for survival under variable temperatures. From March to November, we extracted lipids from surface workers of 14 colonies while simultaneously recording ground temperature. We first assessed if lipid content was highest during cooler temperatures when ants were less active and less metabolically stressed. In doing so, we found that lipid content of ants declined almost 70% from cool months (November lipid content = 14.6%) to hot months (August lipid content = 4.6%). We next assessed if lipid levels from a group of ants collected at a single time point could change by placing individuals into environmental chambers set at 10, 20, and 30°C (i.e. the approximate span of average temperatures from March to November). Temperature again had a significant impact such that after 10 days, lipid content of ants in the hottest chamber (30°C) had decreased more than 75%. While intraspecific variation in physiological traits often follows seasonal patterns, our results suggest fluctuations in temperature may account for a portion of the variance observed in traits like lipid content.</p>

Data from: Temporal and agricultural factors influence E. coli survival in soil and transfer to cucumbers,"<p><em>Escherichia coli</em> survival in soils containing either composted poultry litter (CPL), heat-treated poultry pellets (HTPP), poultry litter (PL) or unamended (chemical fertilizer). Test plots were either covered with plastic mulch (M) or not mulched (NoM). The study was conducted in 2018 and 2019 during cucumber growing seasons at the University of Delaware research farm and each study lasted 120 days. Data from the current study were collected to examine the survival of non-pathogenic <em>Escherichia coli</em> and transfer to cucumbers grown in same field in two separate years.  Soil moisture, total nitrogen, nitrate, total carbon, soluble carbon, soluble solids, rainfall, soil temperature and air temperature, along with the number of days needed for <em>E. coli</em> to decline by 4 log CFU/gdw, were included in random forest models used to a) predict 4-log declines of <em>E. coli</em> inoculated to soils  and b) transfer of <em>E. coli</em> to cucumbers from soils with different biological soil amendments.<br />

1)  Dpi4log, the number of days needed for <em>E. coli</em> levels in various combinations of year, amendment and mulch, were calculated by applying sigmoidal (single, double, triple, or quadruple) model to <em>E. coli</em> data collected over time.<br />
2)  A random forest model using soil and weather data was used to determine which factors listed above best predicted dpi4log values. This model accounted for 98% of the observed variance.<br />
3)  A random forest model using soil and weather data, along with dpi4log, was used to predict transfer of <em>E. coli</em> to soils from cucumbers (log MPN/cucumber). This model accounted for approximately 63% of the variance in the study.</p>

"Data from: The Pacific Biosciences de novo assembled genome dataset from a parthenogenetic New Zealand wild population of the longhorned tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann, 1901","<p>The longhorned tick, <em>Haemaphysalis longicornis</em>, feeds upon a wide range of bird and mammalian hosts. Mammalian hosts include cattle, deer, sheep, goats, humans, and horses. This tick is known to transmit a number of pathogens causing tick-borne diseases, and was the vector of a recent serious outbreak of oriental theileriosis in New Zealand. A New Zealand-USA consortium was established to sequence, assemble, and annotate the genome of this tick, using ticks obtained from New Zealand's North Island. In New Zealand, the tick is considered exclusively parthenogenetic and this trait was deemed useful for genome assembly. Very high molecular weight genomic DNA was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq4000 and the long-read Pac Bio Sequel platforms. Twenty-eight SMRT cells produced a total of 21.3 million reads which were assembled with Canu on a reserved supercomputer node with access to 12 TB of RAM, running continuously for over 24 days. The final assembly dataset consisted of 34,211 contigs with an average contig length of 215,205 bp. The quality of the annotated genome was assessed by BUSCO analysis, an approach that provides quantitative measures for the quality of an assembled genome. Over 95% of the BUSCO gene set was found in the assembled genome. Only 48 of the 1066 BUSCO genes were missing and only 9 were present in a fragmented condition. The raw sequencing reads and the assembled contigs/scaffolds are archived at the National Center for Biotechnology Information.</p>

"Data from: The assembled transcriptome of the adult horn fly, Haematobia irritans","<p>The horn fly, <em>Haematobia irritans irritans</em> (Linnaeus, 1758; Diptera: Muscidae), a hematophagous external parasite of cattle, causes considerable economic losses to the livestock industry worldwide. This pest is mainly controlled with insecticides; however, horn fly populations from several countries have developed resistance to many of the products available for their control. In an attempt to better understand the adult horn fly and the development of resistance in natural populations, we used an Illumina paired-end read HiSeq and GAII approach to determine the transcriptomes of untreated control adult females, untreated control adult males, permethrin-treated surviving adult males and permethrin + piperonyl butoxide-treated killed adult males from a Louisiana population of horn flies with a moderate level of pyrethroid resistance. A total of 128,769,829, 127,276,458, 67,653,920, and 64,270,124 quality-filtered Illumina reads were obtained for untreated control adult females, untreated control adult males, permethrin-treated surviving adult males and permethrin + piperonyl butoxide-treated killed adult males, respectively. The <em>de novo</em> assemblies using CLC Genomics Workbench 8.0.1 yielded 15,699, 11,961, 2672, 7278 contigs (≥ 200 nt) for untreated control adult females, untreated control adult males, permethrin-treated surviving adult males and permethrin + piperonyl butoxide-treated killed adult males, respectively. More than 56% of the assembled contigs of each data set had significant hits in the BlastX (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database) (E &lt;0.001). The number of contigs in each data set with InterProScan, GO mapping, Enzyme codes and KEGG pathway annotations were: Untreated Control Adult Females – 10,331, 8770, 2963, 2183; Untreated control adult males – 8392, 7056, 2449, 1765; Permethrin-treated surviving adult males – 1992, 1609, 641, 495; Permethrin + PBO-treated killed adult males – 5561, 4463, 1628, 1211.</p>

Data from: The behavioral response to the putative necromones from dead Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) in traps by conspecifics as a function of density and time since capture,"<p>Insect Strains and Rearing<br />
Two field-derived strains of T. castaneum from either Eastern Kansas, collected in 2012, or Riley County, KS, collected in 2019, were used to assess the effect of strain on the behavioral response to necromones. Except where noted, the 2012 field strain was used for each experiment. T. castaneum was reared on a mixture of 95% unbleached flour and 5% brewer’s yeast in an environmental chamber at 27.5ºC, 60% RH, and 14:10 L:D. Subculturing proceeded by adding 75 mixed-sex T. castaneum to a 947-ml mason jar filled two-thirds with mixed diet. Adults were removed after 72 h of oviposition. Mixed sex adults aged 4–8 weeks old were used in all assays. All experiments were performed between the years 2017–2020.</p>
<p>Treatments<br />
Time of Death of Prior Captures on Behavioral Response<br />
For investigating the attraction to kairomone oil based on how long beetles were left in the oil, the following treatments were included: negative control (neg ctrl), 950μL of Trécé Storgard® Kairomone Oil (kairomone oil for the remainder of the manuscript; Adair, OK, USA) only, or 950 μL of kairomone oil plus 25 freshly killed, mixed sex T. castaneum adults aged in the oil for 1, 25, 48, 72, or 96 h. A second round of the beetles aged longer than 8 days was included with the following treatments: negative control (neg ctrl), 950μL of kairomone oil only, or 950 μL of kairomone oil plus 25 freshly killed, mixed sex T. castaneum adults aged in the oil for 8, 9, 10, or 11 d (Table 1). These experiments were performed in a combination of the wind tunnel, release-recapture assay, and two-choice olfactometer (Table 1). Treatments were added to 20 mL GC headspace vials (Gerstel, GmBH, Germany) for wind tunnel assays, while they were added to Trécé Storgard™ Dome® traps in the release-recapture assays.</p>
<p>Influence of Density of Prior Captures on Behavioral Response<br />
In order to evaluate whether the behavioral response of T. castaneum modulates with different densities of conspecifics in traps, the following treatments for the density response study were used: the same negative control, 950 μl of kairomone oil only, or 950 μl of kairomone oil plus either 4, 10, 20, or 40 mixed sex T. castaneum adults that were allowed to incubate for 24 h or 96 h. These experiments were performed in a combination of the wind tunnel, release-recapture assay, and headspace collection/GC-MS (Table 1). Treatments were added to 20 mL GC headspace vials (Gerstel, GmBH, Germany) for wind tunnel assays, while they were added to Trécé Storgard™ Dome® traps in the release-recapture assays.</p>
<p>Effect of Strain on Behavioral Response to Prior Captures<br />
To rule out losing the attraction behaviors from laboratory-rearing protocols, a more recent T. castaneum strain was used and tested against the strain from Eastern Kansas collected in 2012. Thus, both a 2012 and 2019 field-collected (from Riley Co., Kansas) population of T. castaneum were tested in these experiments. The treatments for the strain effect consisted of a negative control, kairomone oil only, and 950 μl of kairomone oil plus either 4, 10, 20, or 40 mixed sex T. castaneum adults, which were allowed to incubate for 24 h. Both strains were tested in the wind tunnel and a release-recapture assay (Table 1).</p>
<p>Effect of Rancidity on Behavioral Response to Prior Captures<br />
We conducted an experiment to test if long-term storage of the kairomone oil may have caused it to become rancid, despite being stored at 4ºC as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Treatments included: 950 μl of the kairomone oil we have used for most of our other experiments (e.g., standard Storgard® kairomone oil, or SSO) only, Storgard® kairomone oil borrowed from a colleague at the Center for Grain and Animal Health Research (CGAHR) (e.g., BSO), corn oil purchased freshly from the market (e.g., CO), or one of each of these treatments + 25 dead T. castaneum (Table 1). Attraction behavior was assessed in the wind tunnel.</p>
<p>Assay Methods<br />
Wind Tunnel Assay<br />
Wind tunnel assays were used to evaluate upwind attraction by T. castaneum to putative necromones (e.g., see Van Winkle et al. 2022 for a description). Briefly, air was generated with a fan (diameter: 36.5 cm) connected to an inlet to the wind tunnel, where the air passed through an activated carbon filter to eliminate impurities from the air, and two successively smaller slatted-metal sieves (73 × 85 cm) to create a laminar airflow, with an average airspeed of 0.38 m/s. A purified, constant, laminar flow of air was pushed over the treatments 13.5 cm upwind of a release arena (21.6 × 27.9 cm). The odor treatments (Table 1) were positioned level with the surface of the release arena in the wind tunnel and were housed in 20 mL glass headspace vials. Caps were removed from the vials when testing commenced.</p>
<p>The adults were placed individually in the center of the release arena and were given 2 min to make a decision, including either leaving on the stimulus edge (upwind) or a non-stimulus edge (three other edges). Adults that did not respond within the timeframe were excluded from statistical analysis. Adults were never tested more than once. All treatments were represented equally in a bout of sampling. The trials were performed inside a walk-in environmental chamber at constant conditions (27.5ºC, 60% RH), with air on purge to vent build-up of odors. Behavior was evaluated using a behavioral response index (BRI) as follows: [(T-C)/N]*100, where T is the number of adults in the treatment leaving on the stimulus edge of the arena, C is the equivalent number for the control, and N is the total sample size for both groups. The BRI can vary from 100 (full attraction) to -100 (full repellency). A total of n = 60 replicate individuals were tested, depending on assay, experiment, and treatment.</p>
<p>Release-Recapture Assay<br />
Prior to release, 100 mixed-sex T. castaneum were settled on an 8 × 8 cm slat of cardboard for 24 h. The cardboard containing the adults was then placed in the center of a walk-in environmental chamber (5 × 6 × 2 m) set at a constant 25°C, 65% RH, and 14:10 L:D. Paper was fully laid and carefully taped on the bottom of the chamber floor to allow for easy mobility by T. castaneum. A standard Trécé Dome Trap™ that held one of each treatment (Table 1) was positioned equidistantly along the chamber’s perimeter and randomized between replicates. After 24 h, trap capture totals were calculated equal to the additional number of T. castaneum found in the trap minus those seeded in the original treatment. Experimental treatments were run simultaneously. A total of n = 8 replicates per treatment and experiment combination were used.</p>
<p>Two-Way Olfactometer Trapping<br />
To assess preference among stimuli, T. castaneum individuals were evaluated in a two-way olfactometer. The olfactometer arena consisted of a Petri dish (9 × 1.5 cm diameter:height) with two holes drilled through opposite sides of the base at equal distances from the edge and the center of the dish. A filter paper (85 mm diameter), bisected by a faint line, was placed on the surface of the olfactometer so that the holes were on opposite sides of the filter paper (as in Morrison et al. 2020). The putative necromones (Table 1) were placed in separate, smaller Petri dishes (3.5 cm diameter) below the release arena and centered under each hole. The position of the lure and necromones was randomized between each trial. A single adult was placed in the center of the arena and left for 24 h in an environmental chamber at constant conditions (30C, 65% R.H., 14:10 L:D). A total of n = 10 replicates per comparison were performed. The percent of adults choosing each stimulus and becoming trapped in the bottom petri dish was recorded.</p>
<p>Headspace Collection<br />
Volatiles were collected from traps seeded with 0 (oil only), 4, 20, or 40 dead T. castaneum and aged 24 h or 96 h. Central airflow was first scrubbed with a charcoal filter, then restricted to 1 L/min with flow meters. Airflow was guided through PTFE tubing to 500 mL-capacity headspace glass containers with lids and an inlet for air. The containers also had an outlet with a Porapaq-Q trap that collected volatiles for 3 h. Volatiles were then eluted with 150 µL of dichloromethane. An internal standard of 1 µL of tetradecane was also added prior to being run on the GC-MS according to standard methodology. There were n = 8 replicates per treatment.</p>
<p>Gas Chromatography Coupled with Mass Spectrometry<br />
All headspace collection sample extracts were run on an Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with an Agilent Durabond HP-5 column (30 m length, 0.250 mm diameter, and 0.25 μm film thickness) with He as the carrier gas at a constant 1.2 mL/min flow and 40 cm/s velocity. This was coupled with a single-quadrupole Agilent 5997B mass spectrometer (MS). The compounds were separated by auto-injecting 1 μl of each sample under splitless mode into the GC-MS at room temperature (approximately 23°C). The GC program consisted of 40°C for 1 min followed by 10°C/min increases to 300°C and then held for 26.5 min. After a solvent delay of 3 min, mass ranges between 50 and 550 atomic mass units were scanned. Compounds were tentatively identified by comparison of spectral data with those from the NIST 17 library and by GC retention index. Using the ratio of the peak area for the internal standard to the peak area for the other compounds in the headspace, the emission rates of samples were normalized in ng of volatile per 950 μl aliquot of oil, per μl of solvent, and per h of collection.</p>

Data from: The dispersal capacity of the invasive P. truncatus and the cosmopolitan S. zeamais after brief exposure to a novel insecticide formulation,"<p>Insecticide<br />
Two insecticides were used in this study: an existing formulation (tradename: Diacon IGR+ R ; Central Life Sciences, Schaumberg, IL, USA), and a new formulation with synergist (tradename: Gravista ). Diacon IGR+ contains 11.4% methoprene and 4.75% deltamethrin, with a label rate of 0.12 kg AI/L and 0.05 kg AI/L. The label rate as a residual surface treatment gives a range of 28.5 mL AI/L−171 mL AI/L H2O to cover 94 m2 for both compounds. We used the maximum labeled rate of 24 mg AI/m2 for deltamethrin and 57 mg AI/m2 for methoprene. This corresponded to 0.3 ml of the formulation in 25 ml H2O, sprayed at the rate of 0.3 ml per 50.3 cm2 arena, using an artist’s air brush (Badger 100 series, Badger Corporation, Franklin Park, IL, US) for each treatment. Each replicate was evenly applied to the concrete dish using a compressor pump. The new Gravista formulation has one labeled rate of 684 ml formulation/L H2O to cover 92.9 m2. To achieve this, we mixed 0.5 ml of the new formulation in 10 ml H2O. This was sprayed at the same rate as the other compound. Distilled water was used for the control arenas at 0.3 mL per arena. The arenas were given 8 h to dry prior to use in experiments. Insects (20 of each species per replicate) were exposed on the insecticide-treated petri dishes for either 4 or 24 h. After exposure, individual Prostephanus truncatus and Sitophilus zeamais<br />
 were removed and placed into clean Petri dish arenas and evaluated for condition. Using a stereomicroscope (SMZ-18, Nikon Inc., Tokyo, Japan) under 60× magnification, P. truncatus and S. zeamais were classified as alive (moving normally, is able to right itself when flipped over, no twitching), affected (moving sluggishly or erratically, unable to right itself, twitching of antennae or legs may be present), or dead (completely immobile even after prodding) according to prior published definitions (Ranabhat et al., 2022).<br />
Dispersal and Mortality<br />
To test dispersal capacity to new food patches, a dispersal apparatus was employed. Species-specific cohorts of 20 adults (P. truncatus or S. zeamais) were exposed to Gravista, IGR+, or an untreated control as above for 4 or 24 h, then given 48 h to disperse across 30 or 70 cm standardized sections of PVC pipe (3.175 cm ID). After exposure to insecticide formulations, insects were evaluated for condition after exposure before placing them in the dispersal apparatus. The ends of both sides of the PVC pipe were sealed with mesh (425 μm) to prevent escape. At the far end of the pipe, a hole (2 cm D) was drilled and centered over a glass jar (5 × 6.5 cm D:H) to create a pitfall trap design. The glass jar contained 20 g of whole maize kernels, representing a novel food patch, to induce insects to disperse with food kairomones. Untreated, clean, and uninfested yellow maize was used in the experiments. Grain was sourced from Heartland Mills (Marienthal, KS, USA), and frozen for 72 h prior to use to ensure no prior insect infestation was present. At the end of the sampling period, the number of insects in the jar and their mortality was scored as alive, affected or dead. In addition, the position of each individual was recorded as residing in zone 1 (at the release point), zone 2 (in first half of tube), zone 3 (in second half of tube), or zone 4 (collection jar with maize). In total, there were n = 12 replicate cohorts for each species and combination of distance and treatment. In total, 1,440 P. truncatus and 1,440 S. zeamais were tested in this experiment.</p>

<p>Methods: Six H2N2 low pathogenic avian influenza viruses from US LBMs were selected based on recency and to represent the different genotypes present in the live birds markets during the time period (i.e., the presence or absence of a NA stalk deletion): A/duck/PA/14-030488-5/2014 (Dk/PA/14), A/chicken/NY/16-032621-2/2016 (Ck/NY/16), A/chicken/CT/17-008911-4/2017 (Ck/CT/17), A/chicken/NY/18-002471-4/2018 (CK/NY/02471/18), A/chicken/NY/18-042097-3/2018 (Ck/NY/042097/18) and A/chicken/NY/19-012787-1/2019 (Ck/NY/19). Isolates were evaluated in White Leghorn chickens (Gallus gallus), guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) and Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos). Chickens and guinea fowl were challenged at 4 weeks of age and Pekin ducks were challenged at 2 weeks of age with 6log10 of virus by the intra-choanal route. “Contact” birds, which were hatch-mates of the inoculated birds, were co-housed with the inoculated birds 24hrs post inoculation to evaluate transmission. Viral loads in OP and CL swabs collected at 2, 4, 7, 10, and 14 days post inoculation were determined by quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). RNA was extracted from swabs using the MagMAX96 Viral RNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and the KingFisher Flex Magnetic Particle Processing System (Thermo Fisher Scientific), with an additional wash step to remove inhibitors (Das et al., 2009). The qRT‐PCR for AIV detection was conducted based on the standard USDA M gene AIV qRT‐PCR procedure (Spackman et al., 2002) using an Applied Biosystems® 7500 Fast Real‐Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cycle threshold (Ct) values were determined by the 7500 Fast Software v2.3. For relative quantification, Ct values were converted to titer equivalents based on the standard curve method (Larionov et al., 2005). Values were established from ten-fold dilutions of the same titrated stock of the virus used to challenge the birds. The limit of detection was determined to be 0.8Log10 per reaction. Serological testing for antibodies to the virus utilized the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays using homologous antigens were performed to quantify antibody responses with serum collected from chickens, guinea fowl and Pekin ducks at 14 dpi based on the standard protocol (OIE, 2019). HI titers were reported as reciprocal log2 titers, and titers greater than 3 log2 (1:8) were considered positive.</p>

<p>Genetic and genomic tools for Culicoides biting midges are lacking, despite the fact that they vector a large number of arboviruses and other pathogens impacting humans and domestic animals world-wide. Libraries of tissue-specific transcripts expressed in response to feeding and oral virus challenge in C. sonorensis have previously been reported, but extensive genome-wide expression profiling in the midge has not. Here, we successfully used deep sequencing technologies to construct the first adult female C. sonorensis reference transcriptome, and utilized genome-wide expression profiling to elucidate the genetic response to blood and sucrose feeding over time. The adult female midge unigene consists of 19,041 genes, of which less than 7% are differentially expressed during the course of a sucrose meal, while up to 52% of the genes respond significantly in blood-fed midges, indicating hematophagy induces complex physiological processes. Many genes that were differentially expressed during blood feeding were associated with digestion (e.g. proteases, lipases), hematophagy (e.g., salivary proteins), and vitellogenesis, revealing many major metabolic and biological factors underlying these critical processes. Additionally, key genes in the vitellogenesis pathway were identified, which provides the first glimpse into the molecular basis of anautogeny for C. sonorensis. This is the first extensive transcriptome for this genus, which will serve as a framework for future expression studies and in informing a reference genome assembly and annotation. Moreover, this study will serve as a foundation for subsequent studies of genome-wide expression analyses during early virus infection and dissecting the molecular mechanisms behind vector competence in midges.</p>

"Data from: The testes transcriptome of the New World Screwworm, Cochliomyia hominivorax","<p>The New World Screwworm (NWS), <em>Cochliomyia hominivorax</em>, is a pest insect that is endemic to subtropical and tropical regions of the Western Hemisphere. The female lays eggs in open wounds or orifices of warm-blooded animals. Upon hatching, the resulting larvae feed upon the host's living tissues, which can become infected and death can occur. The sterile insect technique was developed to eradicate this pest from North America and new female conditional-lethal strains that generate only male individuals are being developed for use in the eradication program. To facilitate the identification of useful transcripts and gene promoters for these new strains, an Illumina Hi-Seq protocol was used  to sequence the testes transcriptome of NWS. This study reports the assembly of 4149 transcripts (≥200 nt) from testes dissected from NWS males obtained from the J06 strain used in the screwworm production plant in Pacora, Panama. Functional annotation resulted in 2060, 2031, 558, and 325 transcripts with assigned BlastX, Gene Ontology, Enzyme Codes, and KEGG pathway information, respectively. In the Gene Ontology annotations, 6% and 3% of the transcripts in the Biological Process Ontology were noted as Developmental Process and Reproduction, respectively. Supplementary data includes FastA sequences of the final assembled dataset contigs and a table of Functional annotation information for the NWS testes transcripts. This dataset will serve as a resource to facilitate studies of sex determination in the NWS and the development of recombinant vectors that can be used to create new male-only strains of NWS.</p>

"Data from: Thermal tolerance of western corn rootworm: critical thermal limits, knock-down resistance, and chill coma recovery","<p>Data files for manuscript titled ""Thermal tolerance of western corn rootworm: critical thermal limits, knock-down resistance, and chill coma recovery"".</p>
<p>Metadata is contained within excel file that describes all variables for each tab.</p>
<p>Abstract from paper:<br />
Western corn rootworm, <em>Diabrotica virgifera virgifera</em>, is one of the most economically important crop pests in the world with estimates of damage and control approximating over $1 billion USD annually. Despite an abundance of research devoted to studying rootworm biology in the central Corn Belt of the United States, key aspects on their thermal ecology are still lacking. Here we address this knowledge gap by measuring critical thermal limits, knock-down resistance, and chill coma recovery. In doing so, we also address methodological questions surrounding measurements of thermal tolerance using a variety of dynamic and static assays. The average critical thermal maxima across all trials was 43.0°C, while the average critical thermal minima was 2.5°C. Critical thermal limits were relatively invariant across all treatments except at faster ramping rates. Knock-down resistance decreased with increasing temperature as survival dropped from 100% at 39°C to 0% within 10 minutes at 44°C. Recovery from chill coma increased by 1.62 minutes for each hour of exposure at 0°C, while survival decreased by 50% after only 24 hours. Combined, our results present the first composite picture of different thermal traits for western corn rootworm, which will be vital for predicting their survival and potential spread under future climate change scenarios.</p>

Data from: Thinking Like a Grassland: Challenges and Opportunities for Biodiversity Conservation in the Great Plains of North America,"<p>Conservation planning in the Great Plains often depends on understanding the degree of fragmentation of the various types of grasslands and savannas that historically occurred in this region.  To define ecological subregions of the Great Plains, we used a revised version of Kuchler’s (1964) map of the potential natural vegetation of the United States. The map was digitized from the 1979 physiographic regions map produced by the Bureau of Land Management, which added 10 physiognomic types. All analyses are based on data sources specific to the United States; hence, we only analyze the portion of the Great Plains occurring in the United States.We sought to quantify the current amount of rangeland in the US Great Plains converted due to 1) woody plant encroachment; 2) urban, exurban, and other forms of development (e.g., energy infrastructure); and 3) cultivation of cropland. At the time of this analysis, the most contemporary measure of land cover across the United States was the 2011 NLCD (Homer et al. 2015). One limitation of the NLCD is that some grasslands with high rates of productivity, such as herbaceous wetlands or grasslands along riparian zones, are misclassified as cropland. A second limitation is the inability to capture cropland conversion occurring after 2011 (Lark et al. 2015). Beginning in 2009 (and retroactively for 2008), the US Department of Agriculture - NASS has annually produced a Cropland Data Layer (CDL) for the United States from satellite imagery,<br />
which maps individual crop types at a 30-m spatial resolution. We used the annual CDLs from 2011 to 2017 to map the distribution of cropland in the Great Plains.  We merged this map with the 2011 NLCD to evaluate the degree of fragmentation of grasslands and savannas in the Great Plains as a result of conversion to urban land, cropland, or woodland.  We produced two maps of fragmentation (best case and worst case scenarios) that quantify this fragmentation at a 30 x 30 m pixel resolution across the US Great Plains, and make them available for download here.</p>

Data from: Toll-like receptor ligands enhance vaccine efficacy against virulent Newcastle disease virus challenge in chickens,"<p>To enhance the efficacy of the current Newcastle disease vaccine, we have tested two potential adjuvants (Imiquimod and ODN-1826) in chickens. Birds were treated with PBS, Imiquimod or ODN-1826 (50 µg/bird) or vaccinated intranasally with live LaSota strain with or without Imiquimod or ODN-1826 (50 µg/bird). Two weeks after vaccination, birds were challenged with virulent New-castle disease virus (chicken/CA/212676/2002). The experimental setting was a laboratory with animal care as approved by the institutional animal care and use committee as appropriate for the species and age of bird. Data are the serum antibody titers to the vaccine or challenge virus as determined by hemagglutination inhibition assay. Virus shedding titers by the oral and cloacal route for individual birds exposed to virulent Newcastle disease virus were determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Expression of antiviral genes from tissues collected at 1 and 3 days after treating 2 week old SPF chickens with adjuvant and/or vaccines were determined by quantitative PCR.</p>

Data from: Topical application of synthetic hormones terminated reproductive diapause to facilitate rearing of a univoltine weevil for weed biological control agent,"<p>These are results of a series of laboratory experiments to determine if topical application of methoprene and 20-ecdysone can terminate reproductive diapause of the weevil, <em>Ceratapion basicorne</em>, which is a recently permitted biological control agent of yellow starthistle (<em>Centaurea solstitialis</em>).  Adult weevils feed on leaves, creating pin holes, and lay eggs inside leaves.  Diapausing weevils were treated with various doses of methoprene (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 micrograms) dissolved in acetone in experiments 1 and 2. They were treated sequentially first with acetone or 20-ecdysone (1.0 microgram) and then with methoprene (1.0 microgram) in experiment 3 and were treated with 20-ecdysone followed by methoprene in experiment 4.</p>

Data from: Towards predicting biochar impacts on plant-available soil nitrogen content,"<p>Biochars are charcoals used as soil amendments, and they have many beneficial effects on soil health. However, one negative effect is biochars often reduce concentrations of soil nitrogen that are available to plants. This is believed to be due to the high carbon and low nitrogen contents of biochars, which deprive soil microbes of nitrogen as they decompose the biochar, and cause microbes to tie up nitrogen from soil. We tested whether we could predict biochar impacts on soil nitrogen from the quantities of carbon and nitrogen in biochar that can be consumed soil microbes. Because biochars are mostly composed of carbon in molecules that can not be consumed by microbes, the microbially-available portion is generally small. We measured the microbially-available carbon and nitrogen in ten biochars, and measured how they impacted nitrogen concentrations in two soils from Oregon.</p>
<p>This dataset includes characteristics of ten biochars and two soils, and measurements from two incubation experiments. In the first experiment we incubated 13C-labeled biochars with two soil for 101 days, and measured production of biochar- and soil-respired CO2 and soil dissolved inorganic nitrogen. In the second experiment we expanded to study ten biochar types, including seven biochars that were not isotopically-labeled. We measured how much dissolved inorganic nitrogen was produced by amended soils over 28 days.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, we found all ten biochars increased rather than decreased soil nitrogen concentrations one month after application. We also found that biochars produced at high temperatures, which were more difficult for soil microbes to consume than low-temperature biochars, stimulated more soil decomposition and released more soil nitrogen. It appeared that microbes increased soil decomposition in response to additions of  biochar, and this then increased plant-available nitrogen at least temporarily. These unexpected results show that biochar can sometimes have beneficial impacts on soil nitrogen, and that biochar impacts cannot be readily predicted from the qualities of the biochars themselves. These results are relevant to biochar users, and to biochar producers interested in how to make biochars more beneficial for plant growth. These results indicate that biochar users cannot predict nitrogen impacts, and should therefore monitor soil nitrogen concentrations to ensure levels are sufficient for plant growth.</p>

Data from: Toxicity of herbicides used for control of waterhyacinth in the California Delta towards the planthopper Megamelus scutellaris released for biological control,"<p>Data from five laboratory bioassays and three field mesocosm studies performed by Dr. Patrick Moran of the USDA-ARS Invasive Species and Pollinator Health Research Unit, to examine the toxicity of five herbicides (2,4-D, glyphosate, imazamox, penoxsulam and diquat) and two surfactants that are often applied with herbicides (a paraffinic-oil based one and a vegetable oil-based one) to the planthopper Megamelus scutellaris (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) released in the US for biological control of waterhyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes or Pontederia crassipes) an invasive floating aquatic weed. The studies were performed between 2016 and 2021 to support integrated management of waterhyacinth in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of northern California. The planthopper has also been released in Florida and Mississippi, and in South Africa. Herbicide applications are often still necessary where this planthopper and other biocontrol agents have been released. The research question was 'can the planthopper survive exposure to the herbicides and surfactants?'. In lab bioassays, planthoppers from greenhouse colonies were exposed to herbicide-dipped leaves for 24 hours and then allowed to feed for six days on untreated plants. Planthoppers were then collected, frozen and counted. Exposure to diquat or the paraffinic oil-based surfactant caused 40% to 69% greater mortality than did exposure to water-dipped leaves in more than one trial, while the other four herbicides and the vegetable oil-based surfactant were not toxic. In field mesocosm tests, mesocosms were established in 21L tanks caged with mesh tents, and plants allowed to grow for 4 weeks. Between 150 and 240 adult planthoppers were then released into each mesocosm. The following day, mesocosms were sprayed with herbicide, surfactant or insecticide solutions or an insecticide positive control. Three days later, planthoppers were collected with vacuums, frozen and counted. Only treatment with the paraffinic oil-based surfactant reduced final counts (by 36% to 49%) in a manner that was statistically significant compared to water-sprayed mesocosms in more than one mesocosm field trial, along with the insecticide positive control (by up to 98%). Diquat reduced final counts by 64% in one trial. The results indicate that, with the possible exception of diquat, exposing planthoppers to herbicides does not cause significant mortality, consistent with prior regulatory evaluations of these herbicides as being safe for insects. A surfactant that is often applied with the herbicides is toxic to the planthopper, consistent with expectations that this surfactant, designed to break down plant waxes on leaf surfaces, is likely also harmful to insect cuticular waxes, which insects rely on to contain body fluids. Leaving unsprayed refuges for the planthopper may be a useful component of integrated waterhyacinth control programs.</p>

"Data from: Transcriptomic and functional resources for the Small Hive Beetle Aethina tumida, a worldwide parasite of honey bees","<p>Supplemental information from a project describing the transcriptome of a beetle parasite of honey bees</p>
<p>The small hive beetle (SHB), Aethina tumida, is a major pest of managed honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies in the United States and Australia, and an emergent threat in Europe. While strong honey bee colonies generally keep SHB populations in check, weak or stressed colonies can succumb to infestations. This parasite has spread from a sub-Saharan Africa to three continents, leading to immense management and regulatory costs. We performed a transcriptomic analysis involving deep sequencing of multiple life stages and both sexes of this species. The assembled transcriptome appears to be nearly complete, as judged by conserved insect orthologs and the ability to find plausible homologs for 11,952 proteins described from the genome of the red flour beetle. Expressed genes include each of the major metabolic, developmental and sensory groups, along with genes for proteins involved with immune defenses and insecticide resistance. We also present a total of 23,085 high-quality SNP's for the assembled contigs. We highlight potential differences between this beetle and its honey bee hosts, and suggest mechanisms of future research into the biology and control of this species. SNP resources will allow functional genetic analyses and analyses of dispersal for this invasive pest.</p>

Data from: Trends and sensitivities of low streamflow extremes to discharge timing and magnitude in Pacific Northwest mountain streams,"<p>Path analyses of historical streamflow data from the Pacific Northwest indicate that the precipitation amount has been the dominant control on the magnitude of low streamflow extremes compared to the air temperature‐affected timing of snowmelt runoff. The relative sensitivities of low streamflow to precipitation and temperature changes have important implications for adaptation planning because global circulation models produce relatively robust estimates of air temperature changes but have large uncertainties in projected precipitation amounts in the Pacific Northwest U.S. Quantile regression analyses indicate that low streamflow extremes from the majority of catchments in this study have declined from 1948 to 2013, which may significantly affect terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and water resource management. Trends in the 25th percentile of mean annual streamflow have declined and the center of timing has occurred earlier. We quantify the relative influences of total precipitation and air temperature on the annual low streamflow extremes from 42 stream gauges using mean annual streamflow as a proxy for precipitation amount effects and streamflow center of timing as a proxy for temperature effects on low flow metrics, including 7q10 summer (the minimum 7 day flow during summer with a 10 year return period), mean August, mean September, mean summer, 7q10 winter, and mean winter flow metrics. These methods have the benefit of using only readily available streamflow data, which makes our results robust against systematic errors in high elevation distributed precipitation data. Winter low flow metrics are weakly tied to both mean annual streamflow and center of timing.</p>

Last seasons senesced plant material that is alive but not photosynthetic is coded as '.'. There may be 0, 1, 2 or more canopy hits for each pin (numbered 1 through n with 1 being the top-most canopy hit). A final basal hit is recorded for each pin and coded as hit 0. The point frame was moved so that a total of 5 rows were recorded for a total of 100 pins for each plot. The plant species codes used follow the USDA Plants Database.</p>

Data from: USDA ARS Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory (NGPRL) legacy livestock production (1916-2016) under various rangeland managements with stocking rate and seeded crested wheatgrass,"<p>Established in 1912, the Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory (NGPRL) is a USDA Agricultural Research Service facility located in Mandan, Morton County, North Dakota.  In 1916, NGPRL scientists established a long-term rangeland management research project focusing on developing the most appropriate stocking rates for rangelands in the region.  The research project ran for 100 years and included pasture 62, a heavily stocked pasture, and 66, a moderately stocked pasture for the entire time. Also, in 1931, pasture 37 was converted from smooth bromegrass to crested wheatgrass, which was both lightly and moderately stocked. NGPRL's grazing season is traditionally May-October which reflects the surrounding region. Animals may be put on slightly later or pulled earlier due to extreme weather conditions or events (e.g. drought, blizzard). The legacy livestock production data from these pastures include 100 years (1916-2016) of livestock production data from pastures 62 and 66 and 84 years (1932-2016) from pasture 37. Pasture 37 was fertilized annually in spring with 40 pounds nitrogen urea [46-0-0] per acre until 2010 and after that it was fertilized intermittently. Grazing treatments on these pastures were applied with stocking rates calculated in 1916 based on 600 lb. animal. Stocking rates were adjusted when pasture sizes were decreased, and this information is included in the data dictionary for the stocking rate and AUM data table. Please note data is missing from 1984 and 1985 from all the pastures.<br />
Johnson Thatcher Sarvis established the experiment in 1915 and managed it until 1940. The experiment was continued by George Rogler from 1940 to 1952, Russell Lorenz and George Rogler from 1953 to 1973, Russell Lorenz from 1974 to 1979, Lenat Hofmann from 1980 to 1992, and James Karns from 1993 to 2002. Numerous technicians and part-time students were also involved in the day-to-day management and conduct of the experiment. We would like to recognize these scientists and support staff for their extraordinary foresight and determination in skillfully managing and continuing this experiment into the twenty-first century. Thanks also to Holly Johnson at the Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory for organizing, cataloging, and annotating the publications from the long-term experiment.</p>

Data from: Update to the USDA-ARS Fixed-Wing Spray Nozzle Models,"<p>Published in Transactions of the ASABE 58(2): 281-295 (doi: 10.13031/trans.58.10896). 2015 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.</p>
<p>The current USDA-ARS aerial spray nozzle models were updated to reflect both new standardized measurement methods and systems as well as to increase operational spray pressure, aircraft airspeed, and nozzle orientation angle limits. The new models were developed using both central composite design and custom design response surface methodologies, which provide excellent fits to independently measured data (R2 values ranging from 0.81 to 0.99) for all droplet size parameters. The new models also updated the droplet size classification ratings by adopting a previously recommended set of nozzles and operational pressures that provide similar data to ASABE Standard Reference nozzles but are evaluated under aerial application conditions (primarily airspeed). Generally, for flat fan and deflection type nozzles, the new models result in increases to predicted DV0.1 data (droplet diameter at which 10% of the total spray volume is contained in droplets of equal or lesser diameter), decreases in DV0.5 and DV0.9 data (similar to DV0.1 but 50% and 90% of total spray volume), and increases in the percent of spray contained in droplets of 200 µm diameter or smaller. With straight stream nozzles, the DV0.1, DV0.5, and DV0.9 trends tend to be reversed. Droplet size classifications with the new models for flat fan and deflector type nozzles tend to shift ratings downward, as compared to the current models, with classes centered around fine and medium sprays. However, with straight stream nozzles, droplet size classifications tend to shift ratings upward as compared to the current models. The updated models will be used to populate spreadsheet and mobile device software-based user interfaces to provide aerial applicators with droplet size information for an increased range of nozzles and operational settings, allowing for better nozzle selection and operational guidance.</p>

Data from: Use of long-read sequencing simulators to assess real-world applications for food safety,"<p>Shiga toxin-producing <em>Escherichia coli</em> (STEC) and <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> are responsible for severe foodborne illnesses in the United States. Current identification methods require at least four days to identify STEC and six days for <em>L. monocytogenes</em>. Adoption of long-read, whole genome sequencing for testing could significantly reduce the time needed for identification, but method development costs are high. Therefore, the goal of this project was to use NanoSim-H software to simulate Oxford Nanopore sequencing reads to assess the feasibility of sequencing-based foodborne pathogen detection and guide experimental design. Sequencing reads were simulated for STEC, <em>L. monocytogenes</em>, and a 1:1 combination of STEC and <em>Bos taurus</em> genomes using NanoSim-H. This dataset includes all of the simulated reads generated by the project in fasta format. This dataset can be analyzed bioinformatically or used to test bioinformatic pipelines.</p>

Data from: Variation in genome size and karyotype among closely-related aphid parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae),"<p>We measured genome sizes and determined the karyotypes of nine species of aphid parasitoids in the genus Aphelinus. We found large differences in genome size and karyotype between Aphelinus species, which is surprising given the similarity in their morphology and life history. Genome sizes estimated from flow cytometry were larger for species in the mali complex than those for the species in the daucicola and varipes complexes. Haploid karyotypes of the daucicola and mali complexes comprised five metacentric chromosomes of similar size, whereas those of the varipes complex had four chromosomes, including a larger and a smaller metacentric chromosome and two small acrocentric chromosomes or a large metacentric and three smaller acrocentric chromosomes. Total lengths of female haploid chromosome sets correlated with genome sizes estimated from flow cytometry. Phylogenetic analysis of karyotypic variation revealed a chromosomal fusion together with pericentric inversions in the common ancestor of the varipes complex and further pericentric inversions in the clade comprising Aphelinus kurdjumovi and Aphelinus hordei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with a 28S ribosomal DNA probe revealed a single site on chromosomes of the haploid karyotype of Aphelinus coreae. The differences in genome size and total chromosome length between species complexes matched the phylogenetic divergence between them.</p>
<p><strong>Materials and Methods</strong></p>
<p><strong>Specimens</strong><br />
The parasitoid species studied and the sources of the colonies are listed in the data file ""<a href=""https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/data-variation-genome-size-and-karyotype-among-closely-related-aphid-parasitoids-0"">Aphelinus_species_studied.csv</a>"". These colonies were reared on aphids at the USDA-ARS, Beneficial Insect Introductions Research Unit, in Newark, Delaware, USA. Females of the yellow-white strain of Drosophila melanogaster (Meigen, 1830) (stock number 1495, obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center at Indiana University, <a href=""http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu"">http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu</a>) were used as internal controls for flow cytometry. All institutional and national guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals were followed.</p>
<p><strong>Flow cytometry</strong><br />
Live Aphelinus were sexed, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. To estimate genome sizes, we used the flow cytometry protocol described by Hanrahan and Johnston (2011) and Hare and Johnston (2011). We dissected heads from both males and females of the Aphelinus species in cold Galbraith buffer (Galbraith et al. 1983). Heads of female D. melanogaster were used as internal standards (1C = 175 Mb or 0.17 pg). To release the nuclei from cells, 15 female Aphelinus heads and one female Drosophila head, were ground together in one milliliter of cold Galbraith buffer using 15 strokes of the ""A"" pestle in a 2-ml Kontes Dounce tissue grinder. Three to six replicates were done for females and males of each species, but because male genome sizes were too close to that of Drosophila, we used heads from females of the same parasitoid species as internal standards for males. The samples were passed through a 35 micron filter and then stained with 40 parts per million of propidium iodide in the dark for 3-5 hours at 4°C. Samples were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur Flow Cytometer with laser excitation at 488 nm. Red fluorescence from the propidium iodide was detected using an FL2 filter. The haploid content of DNA in megabases (Mb) was calculated for each Aphelinus sample from the ratio of mean fluorescence of the sample to mean fluorescence of the standard times the genome size of the standard. We report genome size estimates in megabases, but also give estimates in picograms (pg) calculated by dividing the amount of DNA in Mb by the standard 1C value of 978 Mb.</p>
<p><strong>Karyotypes</strong><br />
Chromosome preparations were made from cerebral ganglia of prepupae using a modified version of the technique in Imai et al. (1988). Wasps were dissected in 0.5% hypotonic sodium citrate solution containing 0.005% colchicine, and the tissues were incubated in fresh solution for ~30 minutes at room temperature. The material was transferred to a pre-cleaned microscope slide using a Pasteur pipette and gently flushed with Fixative I (glacial acetic acid: absolute ethanol: distilled water 3:3:4). Tissues were disrupted in an additional drop of Fixative I using dissecting needles. Another drop of Fixative II (glacial acetic acid: absolute ethanol 1:1) was then applied to the center of the area and blotted off the edges of the slide. The slide was air dried for ~30 minutes at room temperature. For conventional staining, preparations were stained with freshly prepared 3% Giemsa solution in 0.05M Sørensen's phosphate buffer (Na2HPO4 + KH2PO4, pH 6.8). Mitotic divisions were studied and photographed using an optic microscope Zeiss Axioskop 40 FL fitted with a digital camera AxioCam MRc (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). To obtain karyograms, the resulting images were processed with image analysis programs: Zeiss AxioVision version 3.1 and Adobe Photoshop version 8.0. Mitotic chromosomes were measured for 5-19 cells in 1-4 wasps per species using Adobe Photoshop. We report total length of all chromosomes in each karyotype; for diploid sets, we divided total length by two to make the values comparable to haploid sets. We also report relative lengths (RL; 100 x length of each chromosome divided by total length of the set) and centromeric indices (CI; 100 x length of shorter arm divided by total length of a chromosome). Chromosomes were classified into metacentric (M) or acrocentric (A) according to the guidelines in Levan et al. (1964).</p>

"Data from: Vegetative Buffer Strips for Reducing Herbicide Transport in Runoff: Effects of Buffer Width, Vegetation, and Season","<p>The effectiveness of vegetative buffer strips (VBS) for reducing herbicide transport has not been well documented for runoff prone soils. A multi‐year plot‐scale study was conducted on an eroded claypan soil with the following objectives: (1) assess the effects of buffer width, vegetation, and season on runoff transport of atrazine (ATR), metolachlor (MET), and glyphosate; (2) develop VBS design criteria for herbicides; and (3) compare differences in soil quality among vegetation treatments. Rainfall simulation was used to create uniform antecedent soil water content and to generate runoff. Vegetation treatment and buffer width impacted herbicide loads much more than season. Grass treatments reduced herbicide loads by 19‐28% and sediment loads by 67% compared to the control. Grass treatments increased retention of dissolved‐phase herbicides by both infiltration and adsorption, but adsorption accounted for the greatest proportion of retained herbicide load. This latter finding indicated VBS can be effective on poorly drained soils or when the source to buffer area ratio is high. Grass treatments modestly improved surface soil quality 8‐13 years after establishment, with significant increases in organic C, total N, and ATR and MET sorption compared to continuously tilled control. Herbicide loads as a function of buffer width were well described by first‐order decay models which indicated VBS can provide significant load reductions under anticipated field conditions.</p>

Data from: We built it; did they come? Pollinator diversity and community structure in a post-mining prairie restoration project,"<p>Pollinator and flowering plant surveys were conducted in three mineland reclamation sites in southeast Ohio during 2019. Floral abundance, floral richness, floral evenness, pollinator richness, and pollinator Shannon’s diversity were calculated from these surveys and counts of individual taxa are also included in the dataset. The sampling month (June, July, August, or September) and seeding treatment (Traditional, Native Light, or Native heavy) were also recorded. Sites were privately owned abandoned mine lands and had variable soil conditions, area, seeding dates, and other minor factors, all detailed in Swab et al (2017). Three plots of 0.4 ha were established at each site. Two plots were revegetated with an experimental native prairie seed mix comprised of both non-native species typically used in reclamation, as well as native species including Panicum virgatum, Sorghastrum nutans, Chamaecrista fasciculata, Coreopsis tinctoria, Rudbeckia triloba, Helianthus maximiliani, and Asclepias syriaca, as well as nonnatives Lotus corniculatus, Lolium perenne, and Dactylis glomerata as insurance, at 16.81 kg ha-1 (Native Light) and 33.63 kg ha-1 (Native Heavy) rates. The other plot was revegetated with a non-native mix frequently used in the reclamation of mine lands in Ohio (Traditional), with a seeding rate of 33.63 kg ha-1. Each site was sampled four times from June-September 2019 on warm (21-32°C) days with no rainfall and ≤ 4.0 m/s winds. One site was sampled per day and subsequent sampling events at each site were approximately 4 weeks apart. Within each plot, 25-m transects were established from a central point, choosing direction with a random number generator. One transect per plot was surveyed per round (early morning, late-morning, and afternoon) a total of three per plot. The counts of pollinators and floral units, respectively, were summed by taxa across quadrats and six-minute walks for each plot by sampling session combination (n = 36). To account for blocking by site, plots nested within sites, and repeated measures on plots, random intercepts of site, plot, and interaction of site and plot were included, despite zero variances, in all univariate models.</p>

Data to explore circular manureshed management in beef supply chains of the United States and western Canada,"<p>Circular management of beef supply chains holds great promise for improving sustainability from grazing agroecosystem to dinner plate. In the United States and Canada, one approach to circularity entails transporting manure nutrients from cattle produced in feedlots back to the grazing agroecosystems where they originated to enrich haylands for further grazing cattle production. We provide data to assess this strategy centered around three grazing agroecosystems: Florida, New Mexico, and the provincial assemblage of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, British Columbia. We describe four datasets that can be used to estimate the potential nutrient utilization of hay fed to grazing cattle in the three grazing agroecosystems and the magnitudes of feedlot manure nutrients available for transport back to them. We found that although biogeography and management differ among the three grazing agroecosystems, the hay allocated for grazing cattle represented approximately 65% of the total harvested hay produced per agroecosystem after accounting for harvest losses, and that on average all three areas exported about 450,000 cattle annually for feedlot, pasture, and slaughter to states across the US. Although we highlight only three grazingland settings, our approach relies on methods that could ultimately be scaled nationally and internationally, with applicability to other animal industries for which circular management is an aspiration for sustainability outcomes.</p>

"Dataset for ""Cover crop inclusion and residue retention improves soybean production and physiology in drought conditions""","<p>Data and code for ""Cover crop inclusion and residue retention improves soybean production and physiology in drought conditions""</p>
<p>CONTEXT: Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) planting has increased in central and western North Dakota despite frequent drought occurrences that limit productivity.  Soybean plants need high photosynthetic and transpiration rates to be productive, but they also need high water use efficiency when water is limited. Retaining crop residues and including cover crops in crop rotations are management strategies that could improve soybean drought resilience in the northern Great Plains.   </p>
<p>OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine how a management practice that included cover crops and residue retention impacts agronomic, ecosystem water and carbon dioxide flux, and canopy-scale physiological attributes of soybeans in the northern Great Plains under drought conditions.  </p>
<p>METHODS:  We compared two soybean fields over two years with business-as-usual and aspirational management that included residue retention and cover crops during a drought year.  This comparison was based on yield, aboveground biomass, Phenocam images, and fluxes from eddy covariance and ancillary measurements.  These measurements were used to derive meteorological, physical, and physiological attributes with the ‘big leaf’ framework. </p>
<p>RESULTS: Soybean yields were 29% higher under drought conditions in the field managed in a system that included cover crops and residue retention. This yield increase was caused by extending the maturity phenophase by 5 days, increasing agronomic and intrinsic water use efficiency by 27% and 33%, respectively, increasing water uptake, and increasing the rubisco-limited photosynthetic capacity (Vcmax25) by 42%.</p>
<p>CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of cover crops and residue retention into a cropping system improved soybean productivity because of differences in water use, phenology timing, and photosynthetic capacity.</p>
<p>IMPLICATIONS: These results suggest that farmers can improve soybean productivity and yield stability by incorporating cover crops and residue retention into their management practices because these practices allow soybean plants to shift to a more aggressive water uptake strategy.</p>

Delta Food Outlets Study,"<p>The Delta Food Outlets Study was an observational study designed to assess the nutritional environments of 5 towns located in the Lower Mississippi Delta region of Mississippi. It was an ancillary study to the Delta Healthy Sprouts Project and therefore included towns in which Delta Healthy Sprouts participants resided and that contained at least one convenience (corner) store, grocery store, or gas station. Data were collected via electronic surveys between March 2016 and September 2018 using the Nutrition Environment Measures Survey (NEMS) tools. Survey scores for the NEMS Corner Store, NEMS Grocery Store, and NEMS Restaurant were computed using modified scoring algorithms provided for these tools via SAS software programming. Because the towns were not randomly selected and the sample sizes are relatively small, the data may not be generalizable to all rural towns in the Lower Mississippi Delta region of Mississippi.</p>

Divergence in host specificity and genetics among populations of Aphelinus certus,"<p>These are data on variation in host specificity and genetics among 16 populations of an aphid parasitoid, <em>Aphelinus certus</em>, 15 from Asia and one from North America. Host range was the same for all the parasitoid populations, but levels of parasitism varied among aphid species, suggesting adaptation to locally abundant aphids. Differences in host specificity did not correlate with geographical distances among parasitoid populations, suggesting that local adaption is mosaic rather than clinal, with a spatial scale of less than 50 kilometers. Analysis of reduced representation libraries for each population showed genetic differentiation among them. Differences in host specificity correlated with genetic distances among the parasitoid populations.</p>

"EV Smith Study for Resilient Economic Agricultural Practices in Auburn, Alabama","<p>EV Smith Study for Resilient Economic Agricultural Practices in Auburn, Alabama<br />
There is a potential in the southeastern US to harvest winter cover crops from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) fields for biofuels or animal feed use, but this could impact yields and nitrogen (N) fertilizer response. An experiment was established to examine rye (Secale cereale L.) residue management (RM) and N rates on cotton productivity. Three RM treatments (no winter cover crop (NC), residue removed (REM) and residue retained (RET)) and four N rates for cotton were studied. Cotton population, leaf and plant N concentration, cotton biomass and N uptake at first square, and cotton biomass production between first square and cutout were higher for RET, followed by REM and NC. However, leaf N concentration at early bloom and N concentration in the cotton biomass between first square and cutout were higher for NC, followed by REM and RET. Seed cotton yield response to N interacted with year and RM, but yields were greater with RET followed by REM both years. These results indicate that a rye cover crop can be beneficial for cotton, especially during hot and dry years. Long-term studies would be required to completely understand the effect of rye residue harvest on cotton production under conservation tillage.</p>

"Ecological site identification, soil observations, and geomorphology data collected by the Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) terrestrial program between 2012 and 2021 in the western United States","<p>This metadata is the documentation for the field soil observations, ecological site identification, and geomorphology characteristics collected by the Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) terrestrial program between 2012 and 2021 in 14 states of the western United States. The AIM program is conducted by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)’s and provides information to guide site-specific management of ecosystem functions and services. There are 31,267 monitoring plots (79% of plots) with identified ecological sites and 29,228 plots (74% of plots) containing soil morphology descriptions of soil horizons examined in excavated pits. While soil texture class is observed in most soil horizons (98%), rock fragment volume is the soil property with the least data availability (75%). The consistency of soil data (e.g., clay content observations within the ranges of texture classes) increases as a function of time following guidance in soil profile description training for AIM data collectors. Nearly 47% of AIM plots are found on gentle slopes of 0-5% steepness and on Flat/Plain and Hill/Mountain landscape types. The AIM database is a source of georeferenced soil and geomorphology information that can be used for land management and research on land potential, soil geography, and assessment of soil health indicators across the western United States.</p>

Economic Model of Deficit Irrigation,"<p>This spreadsheet is a model of the economics of deficit irrigation that is described in detail in:  Trout, T.J. and D.T. Manning.  2019.  An economic and biophysical model of deficit irrigation.  Agron. J. 111:1–12.  doi:10.2134/agronj2019.03.0209 . </p>
<p>The model calculates net income from a crop on a unit of land based on a quadratic crop water production function, amount of effective precipitation, irrigation efficiency, cost of the irrigation water supply, crop production costs, and revenue from selling the crop.  The model includes potential income from leasing out saved irrigation water.  All biophysical variables are defined in terms of the relative evapotranspiration.  Net income is maximized by optimizing the amount of water consumed by the crop.</p>
<p>The spreadsheet progressively presents biophysical and economic models of deficit irrigation with water leasing.  Economic and biophysical parameters are input into the highlighted cells of each worksheet.  Parameters from previous worksheets are copied to following worksheets.  Relationships are graphed.  Output is the net income (NI) for a set of biophysical and economic parameters and level of deficit irrigation that maximizes net income.</p>

Economic Model of Deficit Irrigation II (spreadsheet),"<p>This spreadsheet model calculates the net income for irrigated agricultural production.  The model is designed to evaluate the economics of deficit irrigation (irrigation at less than the amount required to produce maximum yield).</p>
<p>The spreadsheet first models the water production function for a crop, then uses that relationship along with crop price and production costs to calculate net income and the irrigation amount that maximizes net income.</p>
<p>This spreadsheet is similar to another posted at Ag Data Commons:  ""Economic Model of Deficit Irrigation"" (<a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1504421"">http://dx.doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1504421</a>).  That model was designed primarily to evaluate deficit irrigation as a means to compare revenue with reduced water consumption to income gained by transferring the saved water.</p>
<p>The model includes two common scenarios:  1)  irrigation water supply is adequate but expensive, and 2)  irrigation water supply is inadequate to fully irrigate the available land.  In the first scenario, net income is maximized when the marginal costs of production, including water, is equal to the marginal revenue.  In the second scenario, net income is maximized when the value of the water is maximized by selecting the portion of the land that should be irrigated.  In the second scenario, the value and costs of the un-irrigated land are included.</p>
<p>The first worksheet of the spreadsheet describes the relationships used in each worksheet and the input parameters required.  Additional worksheets calculate the water production function, the irrigation water production function, and the net income for each of the two scenarios. The worksheets allow the user to input the various biophysical and economic parameters relevant to their conditions and allows evaluating various parameter combinations.  Each worksheet contains graphs to visualize the results.</p>

Effect of Holstein genotype on immune response to an intramammary Escherichia coli challenge,"<p>Since 1964, the University of Minnesota has selectively bred a Holstein herd to maintain genetically static, unselected Holsteins (UH). Comparison of these UH cows with contemporary Holstein (CH) has demonstrated that the UH cows not only produce less milk but also have fewer health concerns than their CH herdmates. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of Holstein genotype on innate immune response in an experimental intramammary <em>E. coli</em> challenge model. Primiparous UH (n= 5) and CH (n = 7) cows received 430 cfu E. coli strain P4 in 1 quarter. Blood samples were collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 7d relative to E. coli infusion.

Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) Model,"<p>Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model is a cropping systems model that was developed to estimate soil productivity as affected by erosion as part of the Soil and Water Resources Conservation Act analysis for 1980, which revealed a significant need for improving technology for evaluating the impacts of soil erosion on soil productivity.  EPIC simulates approximately eighty crops with one crop growth model using unique parameter values for each crop. It can be configured for a wide range of crop rotations and other vegetative systems, tillage systems, and other management strategies. It predicts effects of management decisions on soil, water, nutrient and pesticide movements, and their combined impact on soil loss, water quality, and crop yields for areas with homogeneous soils and management.</p>
<p>EPIC functions on a daily time step and can simulate hundreds of years.  Since the initial development, EPIC has been continually improving through the additions of algorithms to simulate water quality, nitrogen and carbon cycling, climate change, and the effects of atmospheric carbon dioxide.  The processes simulated include leaf interception of solar radiation; conversion to biomass; division of biomass into roots, above ground mass, and economic yield; root growth; water use; and nutrient uptake.  It can be configured for a wide range of crop rotations and other vegetative systems, tillage systems, and other management practices.  The model can also assess the cost of erosion for determining optimal management strategies.</p>

Estimated spring crop yields using Flex Cropping Tool,"<p>Average estimated yields and associated CV values for current (2018) model runs. Based on work done by Harsimran Kaur et al in 2017.  The following is from her thesis:</p>
<p>Agro-ecological classes (AECs) of dryland cropping systems in the inland Pacific Northwest have been predicted to become more dynamic with greater use of annual fallow under projected climate change. At the same time, initiatives are being taken by growers either to intensify or diversify their cropping systems using oilseed and grain legume crops. The main objective of this study was to use a mechanistic model (CropSyst) to provide yield and soil water forecasts at regional scales which could compare fallow versus spring crop choices (flex/opportunity crop). Model simulations were based on historic weather data (1981-2010) as well as combined with actual year weather data for simulations at pre-planting dates starting in Dec. for representative years. Yield forecasts of spring pea, canola and wheat were compared to yield simulations using only weather of the representative year via linear regression analysis to assess pre-plant forecasts. Crop yield projections on pre-plant forecast date of Feb 1st had higher R2 with yield simulated using actual years weather data and lower CVs across the region as compared to forecasts based on historic weather data and other pre-season forecast dates (Dec. 1st and Jan. 1st).  Therefore, Feb. 1st was considered the most reliable time to predict yield and other relevant outputs such as available water forecasts on a regional scale. Regional forecast maps of predicted spring crop yields and CVs showed ranges of 1 to 4367 kg/ha and 11 to 293% for spring canola, 72 to 2646 kg/ha and 11 to 143% for spring pea and 39 to 5330 kg/ha and 11 to 158% for spring wheat across study region for a representative year. These data combined with predicted available water after fallow and following spring crop yield as well as estimates of winter wheat yield reduction would collectively serve as information contributing to decisions related to crop intensification and diversification.</p>

Evaluating accuracy of DNA pool construction based on white blood cell counts,"<p>Pooling individual samples prior to DNA extraction can mitigate the cost of DNA extraction and genotyping; however, these methods need to accurately generate equal representation of individuals within pools. This data set was generated to determine accuracy of pool construction based on white blood cell counts compared to two common DNA quantification methods. Fifty individual bovine blood samples were collected, and then pooled with all individuals represented in each pool. Pools were constructed with the target of equal representation of each individual animal based on number of white blood cells, spectrophotometric readings, spectrofluorometric readings and whole blood volume with 9 pools per method and a total of 36 pools. Pools and individual samples that comprised the pools were genotyped using a commercially available genotyping array. ASReml was used to estimate variance components for individual animal contribution to pools. The correlation between animal contributions between two pools was estimated using bivariate analysis with starting values set to the result of a univariate analysis.</p>

"Evapotranspiration, Irrigation, Dew/frost - Water Balance Data for The Bushland, Texas Alfalfa Datasets","<p>This dataset contains water balance data for each year when alfalfa was grown at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU) research weather station, Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). Alfalfa was grown on two large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field in 1996 through 1999. Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system. Irrigations were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe to 2.4-m depth in the field. The weighing lysimeters were used to measure relative soil water storage to 0.05 mm accuracy at 5-minute intervals, and the 5-minute change in soil water storage was used along with precipitation and irrigation amounts to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ET), which is reported at 15-minute intervals. Because the large (3 m by 3 m surface area) weighing lysimeters are better rain gages than are tipping bucket gages, the 15-minute precipitation data are derived for each lysimeter from changes in lysimeter mass. The land slope is &lt;0.3% and flat.<br />
The water balance data consist of 15-minute and daily amounts of evapotranspiration (ET), dew/frost fall, precipitation (rain/snow), irrigation, scale counterweight adjustment, and emptying of drainage tanks, all in mm. The values are the result of a rigorous quality control process involving algorithms for detecting dew/frost accumulations, and precipitation (rain and snow). Changes in lysimeter mass due to emptying of drainage tanks, counterweight adjustment, maintenance activity, and harvest are accounted for such that ET values are minimally affected. The ET data should be considered to be the best values offered in these datasets. Even though ET data are also presented in the ""lysimeter"" datasets, the values herein are the result of a more rigorous quality control process.

"Evapotranspiration, Irrigation, Dew/frost - Water Balance Data for The Bushland, Texas Maize for Grain Datasets","<p>This dataset contains water balance data for each growing season (year) when maize was grown for grain at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU) research weather station, Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). Maize was grown for grain on two large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system in 1989, 1990, and 1994. In 2013, 2016, and 2018, maize was grown on four lysimeters; two lysimeters and their respective fields were irrigated using subsurface drip irrigation (SDI), and two lysimeters and their respective fields were irrigated by a linear move sprinkler system. Irrigations were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe to 2.4-m depth in the field. The weighing lysimeters were used to measure relative soil water storage to 0.05 mm accuracy at 5-minute intervals, and the 5-minute change in soil water storage was used along with precipitation and irrigation amounts to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ET), which is reported at 15-minute intervals. Because the large (3 m by 3 m surface area) weighing lysimeters are better rain gages than are tipping bucket gages, the 15-minute precipitation data are derived for each lysimeter from changes in lysimeter mass. The land slope is &lt;1% and flat.<br />
The water balance data consist of 15-minute and daily amounts of evapotranspiration (ET), dew/frost fall, precipitation (rain/snow), irrigation, scale counterweight adjustment, and emptying of drainage tanks, all in mm. The values are the result of a rigorous quality control process involving algorithms for detecting dew/frost accumulations, and precipitation (rain and snow). Changes in lysimeter mass due to emptying of drainage tanks, counterweight adjustment, maintenance activity, and harvest are accounted for such that ET values are minimally affected. The ET data should be considered to be the best values offered in these datasets.

The ranch occupies most of the once thriving late 19th- to early 20th-century gold mining community in the Hot Springs Mining District, which was second only in gold production to Alder Gulch. The ranch nearly surrounds the town of Norris. Historically about 900 head of sheep were maintained year-round at the research ranch. The livestock, as well as the rangeland, are used for both teaching and research. Sheep nutrition studies included nutrition levels, management practices and sheep behavior. Animal scientists look at breeding as a major way to improve livestock production. Hybridization was studied in sheep to help predict staple length, open faces, smoothness and body conformation related to better and more meat. These data include ewe and lamb body condition, breeding and production data from 1960-2012.</p>

<p>The ciliate protozoan Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (Ich) is an important parasite of freshwater fish that causes 'white spot disease' leading to significant losses. A genomic resource for large-scale studies of this parasite has been lacking. To study gene expression involved in Ich pathogenesis and virulence, our goal was to generate ESTs for the development of a powerful microarray platform for the analysis of global gene expression in this species. Here, we initiated a project to sequence and analyze over 10,000 ESTs.</p>

<p>Sequencing research requires efficient computation. Few programs use already known information about DNA variants when aligning sequence data to the reference map. New program findmap.f90 reads the previous variant list before aligning sequence, calling variant alleles, and summing the allele counts for each DNA source in a single pass. Advantages are faster processing, more precise alignment, more useful data summaries, more compact output, and fewer steps. Programs findmap and BWA were compared using simulated paired end reads of length 150 from fragments of length 1,000 at random locations within the UMD3.1 bovine reference assembly. Each base had 1% probability of error and 1% probability of missing. The 39 million variants from run 5 of the 1,000 bull genomes project were included, with every other variant set to reference or alternate. With 1 processor, BWA required 629 minutes per 1X for alignment, whereas findmap required 12 minutes per 1X for alignment and variant calling. Percentage of correctly mapped reads was 90.5% from BWA and 92.9% from findmap. Variant calls were output by findmap only for the 88.2% of pairs where both ends were located within the fragment length and of opposite orientation. Percentages of variants called correctly were 99.8% for SNPs and 99.9% for deletions, while insertions had 99.9% of alternate calls correct but only 98.6% of reference calls. Memory required by BWA was 4.6 Gbytes / processor, whereas findmap required 46 Gbytes that could be shared by multiple processors. Simultaneous alignment and variant calling is an efficient and accurate strategy.</p>

"Farming Systems Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Morris, Minnesota","<p>Farming Systems Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Morris, Minnesota<br />
Tillage is decreasing globally due to recognized benefits of fuel savings and improved soil health in the absence of disturbance. However, a perceived inability to control weeds effectively and economically hinders no-till adoption in organic production systems in the Upper Midwest, USA. A strip-tillage (ST) strategy was explored as an intermediate approach to reducing fuel use and soil disturbance, and still controlling weeds. An 8-year comparison was made between two tillage approaches, one primarily using ST the other using a combination of conventional plow, disk and chisel tillage [conventional tillage (CT)]. Additionally, two rotation schemes were explored within each tillage system: a 2-year rotation (2y) of corn (Zea mays L.), and soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) with a winter rye (Secale cereale L.) cover crop; and a 4-year rotation (4y) of corn, soybean, spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) underseeded with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), and a second year of alfalfa. These treatments resulted in comparison of four main management systems CT-2y, CT-4y, ST-2y and ST-4y, which also were managed under fertilized and non-fertilized conditions. Yields, whole system productivity (evaluated with potential gross returns), and weed seed densities (first 4 years) were measured. Across years, yields of corn, soybean and wheat were greater by 34% or more under CT than ST but alfalfa yields were the same. Within tillage strategies, corn yields were the same in 2y and 4y rotations, but soybean yields, only under ST, were 29% lower in the fertilized 4y than 2 yr rotation. In the ST-4y system yields of corn and soybean were the same in fertilized and non-fertilized treatments. Over the entire rotation, system productivity was highest in the fertilized CT-2y system, but the same among fertilized ST-4y, and non-fertilized ST-2y, ST-4y, and CT-4y systems. Over the first 4 years, total weed seed density increased comparatively more under ST than CT, and was negatively correlated to corn yields in fertilized CT systems and soybean yields in the fertilized ST-2y system. These results indicated ST compromised productivity, in part due to insufficient weed control, but also due to reduced nutrient availability. ST and diverse rotations may yet be viable options given that overall productivity of fertilized ST-2y and CT-4y systems was within 70% of that in the fertilized CT-2y system. Closing the yield gap between ST and CT would benefit from future research focused on organic weed and nutrient management, particularly for corn.</p>

FilmPC,"<p>Plastic tarps currently used during soil fumigation to control emissions have been shown to be permeable to fumigant vapors, resulting in appreciable losses to the atmosphere. New low-permeability films are being developed to reduce fumigant emissions and increase efficacy.</p>
<p>A rapid, reliable, and sensitive method is required to measure the permeability of various films that may be used in new management practices. This manuscript presents an approach for estimating the mass transfer coefficient (h) of fumigant compounds across agricultural films. The h is a measure of the resistance to diffusion which, unlike other measures of permeability, is a property of the film-chemical combination and independent of the concentration gradient across the film.</p>
<p>This method uses static sealed cells; fumigant vapor is spiked to one side of the film and the concentrations on both sides of the film are monitored until equilibrium. An analytical model is fitted to the data to obtain h. This model relies on a mass balance approach and includes sorption to and diffusion across the film membrane. The method was tested using two polyethylene films and a very low-permeability film and showed that the method produces a sensitive and reproducible measure of film permeability.</p>

Flat Mites of the World,"<p>Flat Mites of the World provides a portal to a variety of keys, images, and fact sheets to help support identification of this diverse, potentially destructive group of mites.</p>
<p>In Flat Mites of the World Edition 2, you will find interactive keys, fact sheets, descriptions, and images to aid in the identification of flat mites (Acari: Trombidiformes: Tetranychoidea: Tenuipalpidae) from the United States and around the world. Please note that this tool is a work in progress! The newest edition of the tool, updated as of May 2013, will help identify the 38 genera of flat mites present throughout the world, including specific diagnostics for 20 species of Raoiella, 19 species of Brevipalpus, 3 species of Cenopalpus, Dolichotetranychus floridanus, Tenuipalpus pacificus, T. crassulus, and a closely related new species T. nr crassulus. The genus Raoiella is of major concern to quarantine world-wide due to the rapid spread of one species, the red palm mite (RPM), R. indica Hirst. The genus Brevipalpus is the most commonly intercepted genus of Tenuipalpidae in quarantine world-wide, but it is also the most complicated and by far the most diverse genus in the family. The three most important species in the family world-wide, Brevipalpus californicus, B. obovatus and B. phoenicis, though still consistently confused and misidentified, can be identified using this tool, and the Brevipalpus phoenicis species complex has been further separated into seven cryptic species. Dolichotetranychus is increasingly diverse genus of monocot-associated flat mites. Here we present diagnostics for an economically important species associated with pineapple across the world, D. floridanus. Tenuipalpus is a hugely diverse and complicated genus. Tenuipalpus pacificus is the name most commonly applied, correctly or incorrectly, to species in the genus Tenuipalpus intercepted on orchids across the world. We provide diagnostics for T. pacificus, based on type material. A recent incursion in the USA of an unidentified Tenuipalpus mite near T. crassulus sparked our interest in providing diagnostics for these two flat mite species associated with succulent plants.</p>
<p>Exotic species of flat mite pose a significant threat to USA’s biosecurity both as plant pests and as vectors of plant disease; however, the available diagnostics do not allow accurate and reliable identification of species. This tool is aimed at enhancing our diagnostic capabilities for key taxa and to ultimately allow plant protection and quarantine services to develop rapid solutions to serious biosecurity threats. The necessity to accurately and efficiently identify intercepted flat mites will increase as globalization increases. Flat Mites of the World provides a portal to a variety of keys, images, and fact sheets to help support identification of this diverse, potentially destructive group of mites.</p>
<p>This tool is designed to help identify any flat mite to the taxonomic level of genus, and in some cases to species, without the need for expertise in the group. Target users include USDA-APHIS pest survey specialists, ports of entry inspectors, other inspection personnel, students, and scientists. The “Is it a flat mite?” page provides information on how to distinguish a flat mite from other members of the spider mite superfamily Tetranychoidea.</p>
<p><strong>Slide mounted mites:</strong> A flat mite looks very different alive under a stereoscope compared to after it has been squashed flat and slide mounted. Often the 3D shape of the mite is lost in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Microscopy for mites:</strong> When dealing with mites, we are interested mainly in the morphology of surface structures, and DIC offers better interpretation of these features than phase contrast does.</p>
<p>The key is designed for users with limited knowledge about the group to identify flat mites to genus (and to identify critical genera to species). All characters are best observed using DIC (differential interference contrast) on a compound microscope. Ideally the user should have access to a compound microscope with a magnification capacity of 1000X (10X eyepiece + 100X oil objective) with DIC. The microscope images provided in the key were taken using DIC, mostly at 1000X. We highly recommend the use of DIC over Phase Contrast for identifying mites as the optical properties of DIC allow a more accurate interpretation of mite morphology. Please see the “DIC VS Phase Contrast” page for more information.</p>

Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS),"<p>[Note: Integrated as part of FoodData Central, April 2019.]<br />
USDA's Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) is a database that is used to convert food and beverages consumed in What We Eat In America (WWEIA), National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) into gram amounts and to determine their nutrient values.  Because FNDDS is used to generate the nutrient intake data files for WWEIA, NHANES, it is not required to estimate nutrient intakes from the survey. FNDDS is made available for  researchers using WWEIA, NHANES to review the nutrient profiles for specific foods and beverages as well as their associated portions and recipes. Such detailed information makes it possible for researchers to conduct enhanced analysis of dietary intakes. FNDDS can also be used in other dietary studies to code foods/beverages and amounts eaten and to calculate the amounts of nutrients/food components in those items.</p>
<p>FNDDS is released every two-years in conjunction with the WWEIA, NHANES dietary data release. The FNDDS is available for free download from the FSRG website.</p>

Foraging behavior and spatial grazing distribution of free-ranging cattle 2014-2018 on the Central Plains Experimental Range,"<p>Data were collected on the Central Plains Experimental Range (CPER) from 2014-2018, near Nunn, Colorado as part of the common experiments in grazinglands for the Long-Term Agroecosystem Research network.  LTAR scientists seek to create new knowledge regarding sustainable management of grazinglands.  This dataset on cattle foraging behavior and distribution provides new information towards understanding how management practices influence grazing livestock movements in space and time.  The common experiment at CPER is called Collaborative Adaptive Rangeland Management (CARM) and is a ten-year ranch-scale (2,600-ha) social-ecological experiment designed to examine how adaptive rotations of a single large cattle herd among paddocks within a heterogeneous landscape during the growing season (collaborative, adaptive rangeland management; CARM) contrasts with continuous, season-long grazing of paddocks by small non-rotational herds (traditional rangeland management; TRM).  Differences in movement patterns between the two treatments were examined with data collected from global positioning system tracking collars (Lotek 3300LR GPS) combined with activity sensors.  These data were used to determine daily metrics of foraging behavior by steers in both treatments at five-minute intervals and include (1) location, (2) distance moved within 5 minutes, and (3) and grazing activity. These data are from the first half of the CARM experiment to support the publication, ""Adaptive, multi-paddock, rotational grazing management alters foraging behavior and spatial grazing distribution of free-ranging cattle.""</p>

"Fort Ellis Research and Extension Center Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Sidney, Montana","<p>Fort Ellis Research and Extension Center Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Sidney, Montana<br />
Sheep (Ovis aries L.) grazing is an inexpensive method of weed control in dryland cropping systems but little is known about its effect on net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We evaluated the effect of sheep grazing compared to herbicide application for weed control on GHG (CO2, N2O, and CH4) emissions from May to October, 2010 and 2011, net global warming potential (GWP), and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) in a silt loam under dryland cropping systems in western Montana. Treatments were two fallow management practices (sheep grazing [GRAZ] and herbicide application [CHEM]) and three cropping sequences (continuous alfalfa [Medicago sativa L.] [CA], continuous spring wheat [Triticum aestivum L.] [CSW], and spring wheat-pea [Pisum sativum L.] /barley [Hordeum vulgaris L.] hay-fallow [W-P/B-F]). Gas samples were collected at 3 to 14 d intervals with a vented, static chamber. Regardless of treatments, GHG fluxes peaked immediately following substantial precipitation (&gt;12 mm) and/or N fertilization mostly from May to August. Total CO2 flux from May to October was greater in GRAZ with CA, but total N2O flux was greater in CHEM and GRAZ with CSW than in other treatments. Total CH4 flux was greater in CA than in W-P/B-F. Net GWP and GHGI were greater in GRAZ with W-P/B-F than in most other treatments. Greater CH4 flux due to increased enteric fermentation as a result of longer duration of grazing during fallow, followed by reduced crop residue returned to the soil and/or C sequestration rate, probably increased net GHG flux in GRAZ with W-P/B-F. Sheep grazing on cropping sequence containing fallow may not reduce net GHG emissions compared to herbicide application for weed control on continuous crops.</p>

Gas Flux from Band Application,"<p>Gas Flux from Band Application (GF-Band) is an MS Excel spreadsheet tool that calculates the effective gas flux from soil of a multiple-band area to which manure or fertilizer has been applied in bands.  One spreadsheet is for circular gas flux chambers and another is for rectangular chambers.</p>
<p>Greenhouse gases are emitted following application of manure and nitrogen‐containing fertilizers to soil. Manure and fertilizers are often applied in subsurface bands in the soil, or in bands on the soil surface. This article presents a method that has been developed for calculating the effective gas flux for a multiple‐band area to which manure or fertilizer has been applied in bands. The method has been developed for circular and rectangular flux chambers. In analyzing the method, a combination of CO2 gas fluxes from a field experiment that gave a relatively low whole‐plot effective flux and a combination that gave a relatively high whole‐plot effective flux were used. For the lower‐end flux situation, when the dimension of the flux chamber in the direction perpendicular to the band is considerably less than the band spacing, if the flux in a chamber that is centered on a band is assumed to be the whole‐plot effective flux, then this assumption would overestimate the actual whole‐plot effective flux by a considerable amount. The error of this type of assumption is reduced for the higher‐end flux situation, regardless of flux chamber dimensions, and is reduced when the lower‐end flux situation occurs and the dimension of the flux chamber in the direction perpendicular to the band is intermediate to nearly as large as the band spacing. The method in useful in calculating effective gas fluxes for whole plots to which manure or fertilizer has been band‐applied.</p>

In order to understand why the volutella blight fungus is such a weak pathogen and to understand the genetic mechanisms it uses to interact with boxwood, the complete genome of the volutella fungus was sequenced and characterized.  These datasets are generated from the genome sequence of <em>Pseudonectria foliicola</em>, strain  ATCC13545, the fungus responsible for volutella disease of boxwood.  Datasets include the nuclear genome and mitochondrial genome assemblies (sequenced using Illumina technology), the predicted gene model dataset generated using MAKER, the multiple sequence alignment of single-copy orthologs used for phylogenetic analysis, CMAP files generated from SimpleSynteny analysis of mitogenomes, and high quality photographic images.</p>

By 2011, the fungus that causes the disease, <em>Calonectria pseudonaviculata</em>, was found in the U.S., threatening an industry valued at $103 million annually and countless mature landscapes, some dating back to early Colonial times.  Since the first U.S. outbreaks, boxwood blight has been identified from a total of 19 states that together comprise 62% of the total U.S. boxwood production.  A second pathogen, <em>C. henricotiae</em>, was recently described from five European countries. Infection can be latent, and the pathogen may sequester in less susceptible boxwood cultivars.  Because there are no curative treatments—fungicides are at best suppressive of symptoms—infected plants are rendered unfit for sale.  If infected plants are not destroyed, they provide a long-lived source of inoculum that spreads the pathogen by spores or resistant survival structures in soil, air, or water.  Our goal is to provide knowledge and tools needed to reduce the impact of boxwood blight on the green industry.</p>
<p>This database includes genome datasets from <em>Calonectria</em> pathogens of boxwood and related species.</p>

"Geospatial Measurements of Soil Electrical Conductivity, Soil Salinity, and Soil Saturation Percentage in Irrigated Farmland","<p>These data are from soil salinity surveys conducted on California irrigated farmland between 1991 and 2017. The data consist of: (i.) geospatial field survey measurements of bulk soil electrical conductivity (ECa) and (ii.) laboratory determinations of soil salinity (ECe) and saturation percentage (SP) made on soil core sections extracted from the surveyed fields. The data consist of 277,624 ECa measurements and 8,575 ECe and SP determinations.</p>
<p>Soil bulk electrical conductivity (ECa) is relatively easy to measure in agricultural fields using electromagnetic induction (EMI) instrumentation. EMI instruments are readily mobilized and thus can be used to characterize in detail the spatial variability of ECa within fields (Corwin, 2005; 2008). ECa is a useful property because it often correlates with difficult-to-measure soil physical and chemical properties that affect crop production, including soil water content, clay percentage, bulk density, PH, and especially soil salinity. The standard quantitative measure of soil salinity is defined to be the electrical conductivity of the soil saturation paste extract, or ECe (U.S. Salinity Laboratory Staff, 1954). Saturation percentage (SP) is the dry-weight moisture percentage of the saturation paste.</p>
<p>The data can be used to test and explore model relationships between ECe, SP, and ECa (EMv and EMh), as well as their spatial variability. In particular, the data may be useful for comparing and testing modeling approaches that account for both deterministic and random components of soil spatial variability at single-field and multi-field scales, and to support high-resolution digital soil mapping studies across irrigated lands.</p>
<p>Data Files</p>
<p>Data are stored column-wise in two comma-delimited text files, ECe_USDA_ARS_USSL_v01.csv and ECa_USDA_ARS_USSL_v01.csv. Joining the files on the 'ID' column returns data for geolocations at which field measurements of ECa and laboratory determinations of ECe and SP both exist.  For example:</p>

Global RainSIM - Version 1.0,"<p>The purpose of this tool is to estimate daily precipitation patterns for a yearly cycle at any location on the globe. The user input is simply the latitude and longitude of the selected location. There is an embedded Zip Code search routine to find the latitude and longitude for US cities.</p>
<p>GlobalRainSIM forecasts the daily rainfall based upon two databases.The first was the average number of days in a month with precipitation (wet days) that were compiled and interpolated by Legates and Willmott (1990a and 1990b) with further improvements by Willmott and Matsuura (1995). The second database was the global average monthly precipitation data collected 1961-1990 and cross-validated by New et al. (1999). These two datasets were then used to establish the monthly precipitation totals and the frequency of precipitation in a month. The average precipitation event was calculated as the monthly mean divided by the number of wet days. This mean value was then randomly assigned to a day of the month looping through the number of wet days. In other words, if the average monthly rainfall was 10 mm/month with 5 average wet days, each rain event was 2 mm. This amount (2 mm) was then randomly assigned to 5 days of that month. The advantage of this tool is that a typical pattern of precipitation can be simulated for any global location arriving at an •average year• as a baseline case for comparison. This tool also outputs the daily rainfall as a file or can be easily embedded within another program.</p>

"Global Warming Potential Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Mandan, North Dakota","<p>Global Warming Potential Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Mandan, North Dakota<br />
No long-term evaluation of net global warming potential (GWP) for grassland ecosystems in the northern Great Plains (NGP) of North America has been reported. Given this need, we sought to determine net GWP for three grazing management systems located within the NGP. Grazing management systems included two native vegetation pastures (moderately grazed pasture [MGP], heavily grazed pasture [HGP]) and a heavily grazed crested wheatgrass [Agropyron desertorum (Fisch. ex. Link) Schult.] pasture (CWP) near Mandan, ND. Factors evaluated for their contribution to GWP included (i) CO2 emissions associated with N fertilizer production and application, (ii) literature-derived estimates of CH4 production for enteric fermentation, (iii) change in soil organic carbon (SOC) over 44 yr using archived soil samples, and (iv) soil–atmosphere N2O and CH4 fl uxes over 3 yr using static chamber methodology.  Analysis of SOC indicated all pastures to be significant sinks for SOC, with sequestration rates ranging from 0.39 to 0.46 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. All pastures were minor sinks for CH4 (&lt;2.0 kg CH4–C ha−1 yr−1). Greater N inputs within CWP contributed to annual N2O emission nearly threefold greater than HGP and MGP. Due to diff erences in stocking rate, CH4 production from enteric fermentation was nearly threefold less in MGP than CWP and HGP. When factors contributing to net GWP were summed, HGP and MGP were found to serve as net CO2equiv. sinks, while CWP was a net CO2equiv. source. Values for GWP and GHG intensity, however, indicated net reductions in GHG emissions can be most eff ectively achieved through moderate stocking rates on native vegetation in the NGP.</p>

"Grass-Cast Database - Data on aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), climate data, NDVI, and cattle weight gain for Western U.S. rangelands","<p>Grass-Cast: Experimental Grassland Productivity Forecast for the Great Plains</p>
<p>Grass-Cast uses almost 40 years of historical data on weather and vegetation growth in order to project grassland productivity in the Western U.S. More details on the projection model and method can be found at <a href=""https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.3280"">https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.3280</a>.</p>
<p>Every spring, ranchers in the drought‐prone U.S. Great Plains face the same difficult challenge—trying to estimate how much forage will be available for livestock to graze during the upcoming summer grazing season. To reduce this uncertainty in predicting forage availability, we developed an innovative new grassland productivity forecast system, named Grass‐Cast, to provide science‐informed estimates of growing season aboveground net primary production (ANPP). Grass‐Cast uses over 30 yr of historical data including weather and the satellite‐derived normalized vegetation difference index (NDVI)—combined with ecosystem modeling and seasonal precipitation forecasts—to predict if rangelands in individual counties are likely to produce below‐normal, near‐normal, or above‐normal amounts of grass biomass (lbs/ac). Grass‐Cast also provides a view of rangeland productivity in the broader region, to assist in larger‐scale decision‐making—such as where forage resources for grazing might be more plentiful if a rancher’s own region is at risk of drought. Grass‐Cast is updated approximately every two weeks from April through July. Each Grass‐Cast forecast provides three scenarios of ANPP for the upcoming growing season based on different precipitation outlooks. Near real‐time 8‐d NDVI can be used to supplement Grass‐Cast in predicting cumulative growing season NDVI and ANPP starting in mid‐April for the Southern Great Plains and mid‐May to early June for the Central and Northern Great Plains. Here, we present the scientific basis and methods for Grass‐Cast along with the county‐level production forecasts from 2017 and 2018 for ten states in the U.S. Great Plains. The correlation between early growing season forecasts and the end‐of‐growing season ANPP estimate is &gt;50% by late May or early June. In a retrospective evaluation, we compared Grass‐Cast end‐of‐growing season ANPP results to an independent dataset and found that the two agreed 69% of the time over a 20‐yr period. Although some predictive tools exist for forecasting upcoming growing season conditions, none predict actual productivity for the entire Great Plains. The Grass‐Cast system could be adapted to predict grassland ANPP outside of the Great Plains or to predict perennial biofuel grass production.</p>
<p>This new experimental grassland forecast is the result of a collaboration between Colorado State University, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), National Drought Mitigation Center, and the University of Arizona.

"Grass-Cast Database - Data on aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP), climate data, NDVI, and cattle weight gain for Western U.S. rangelands","<p>Grass-Cast: Experimental Grassland Productivity Forecast for the Great Plains</p>
<p>Grass-Cast uses almost 40 years of historical data on weather and vegetation growth in order to project grassland productivity in the Western U.S. More details on the projection model and method can be found at <a href=""https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.3280"">https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ecs2.3280</a>.</p>
<p>Every spring, ranchers in the drought‐prone U.S. Great Plains face the same difficult challenge—trying to estimate how much forage will be available for livestock to graze during the upcoming summer grazing season. To reduce this uncertainty in predicting forage availability, we developed an innovative new grassland productivity forecast system, named Grass‐Cast, to provide science‐informed estimates of growing season aboveground net primary production (ANPP). Grass‐Cast uses over 30 yr of historical data including weather and the satellite‐derived normalized vegetation difference index (NDVI)—combined with ecosystem modeling and seasonal precipitation forecasts—to predict if rangelands in individual counties are likely to produce below‐normal, near‐normal, or above‐normal amounts of grass biomass (lbs/ac). Grass‐Cast also provides a view of rangeland productivity in the broader region, to assist in larger‐scale decision‐making—such as where forage resources for grazing might be more plentiful if a rancher’s own region is at risk of drought. Grass‐Cast is updated approximately every two weeks from April through July. Each Grass‐Cast forecast provides three scenarios of ANPP for the upcoming growing season based on different precipitation outlooks. Near real‐time 8‐d NDVI can be used to supplement Grass‐Cast in predicting cumulative growing season NDVI and ANPP starting in mid‐April for the Southern Great Plains and mid‐May to early June for the Central and Northern Great Plains. Here, we present the scientific basis and methods for Grass‐Cast along with the county‐level production forecasts from 2017 and 2018 for ten states in the U.S. Great Plains. The correlation between early growing season forecasts and the end‐of‐growing season ANPP estimate is &gt;50% by late May or early June. In a retrospective evaluation, we compared Grass‐Cast end‐of‐growing season ANPP results to an independent dataset and found that the two agreed 69% of the time over a 20‐yr period. Although some predictive tools exist for forecasting upcoming growing season conditions, none predict actual productivity for the entire Great Plains. The Grass‐Cast system could be adapted to predict grassland ANPP outside of the Great Plains or to predict perennial biofuel grass production.</p>
<p>This new experimental grassland forecast is the result of a collaboration between Colorado State University, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), National Drought Mitigation Center, and the University of Arizona. Funding for this project was provided by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS), and the National Drought Mitigation Center.</p>

"Greenhouse Gas Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Bowling Green, Kentucky","<p>Greenhouse Gas Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Bowling Green, Kentucky<br />
Alternative N fertilizers that produce low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from soil are needed to reduce the impacts of agricultural practices on global warming potential (GWP). We quantified and compared growing season fluxes of N2O, CH4, and CO2resulting from applications of different N fertilizer sources, urea (U), urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN), ammonium nitrate (NH4 NO3), poultry litter, and commercially available, enhanced-efficiency N fertilizers as follows: polymer-coated urea (ESN), SuperU, UAN + AgrotainPlus, and poultry litter + AgrotainPlus in a no-till corn (Zea maysL.) production system. Greenhouse gas fluxes were measured during two growing seasons using static, vented chambers. The ESN delayed the N2O flux peak by 3 to 4 wk compared with other N sources. No significant differences were observed in N2O emissions among the enhanced-efficiency and traditional inorganic N sources, except for ESN in 2009. Cumulative growing season N2O emission from poultry litter was significantly greater than from inorganic N sources. The N2O loss (2-yr average) as a percentage of N applied ranged from 0.69% for SuperU to 4.5% for poultry litter. The CH4–C and CO2–C emissions were impacted by environmental factors, such as temperature and moisture, more than the N source. There was no significant difference in corn yield among all N sources in both years. Site specifics and climate conditions may be responsible for the differences among the results of this study and some of the previously published studies. Our results demonstrate that N fertilizer source and climate conditions need conideration when selecting N sources to reduce GHG emissions.</p>

Gridded 20-Year Parameterization of a Stochastic Weather Generator (CLIGEN) for South American and African Continents at 0.25 Arc Degree Resolution,"<p>CLImate GENerator (CLIGEN) is a stochastic weather generator that produces daily and sub-daily timeseries of weather variables. The resulting timeseries are statistically similar to observed timeseries considering various temporal scales and climate factors. This dataset consisting of CLIGEN inputs may be used to generate timeseries at any point in a 0.25 arc degree resolution grid covering South American and African continents. Estimated parameter values at each grid point are based on 20-year records taken from global climate datasets. Precipitation parameters are statistically downscaled from grid-scale to point-scale based on observations from globally distributed ground networks representing &gt;10,000 stations. This dataset is intended for use in climate-related research in ungauged areas where observed climate records are unavailable.</p>
<p>The data are formatted as CLIGEN *.par files, which are the only required input for CLIGEN. The files are separated into Africa and South America folders containing n=40936 and n=24588 files, respectively. The files are labeled according to grid point lat/lon coordinates (WGS84) in decimal degrees. The labeling convention uses 'N' and 'E' (north, east) to represent coordinates with a positive sign and 'S' and 'W' (south, west) to represent coordinates with a negative sign.</p>

Gridded 20-year Parameterization of a Stochastic Weather Generator (CLIGEN) to Fill Gaps in Coverage in the Northern Hemisphere,"<p>CLImate GENerator (CLIGEN) is a stochastic weather generator that produces weather time series for soil erosion modeling and various other applications. The generated time series are statistically similar to observed long-term time series. This gridded CLIGEN parameterization with 0.25° spatial resolution complements existing global coverages by filling in remaining gaps that existed in the northern hemisphere (see the map layer *.kmz file with all grid point locations). The coverage is largely represented by Canada, Europe, and Russia and encompasses countries north of ~40°N with no previous known coverage. The CLIGEN inputs may be used to generate daily precipitation, temperature, dewpoint, solar radiation, and wind time series, as well as sub-daily precipitation patterns. The gridded parameterization allows CLIGEN time series to be generated at any point the grid. In particular, the dataset can provide climate drivers for climate-related research in ungauged areas where observed climate records are unavailable.</p>

Alfalfa was grown on two large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. The two square fields were themselves arranged with one directly north of and contiguous with the other. The two fields and lysimeters within each field were designated northeast (NE), and southeast (SE). Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system in autumn 1995 when the alfalfa was planted through 1999. Irrigations were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe to 2.4-m depth in the field.<br />
    The growth and yield data include height, leaf area index, growth stage, total above-ground biomass, leaf and stem biomass, and final yield. Data are from replicate samples in the field and non-destructive (except for harvest) measurements on the weighing lysimeters. In most cases yield data are available from both manual sampling on replicate plots in each field and from machine harvest.<br />
    These datasets originate from research aimed at determining crop water use (ET), crop coefficients for use in ET-based irrigation scheduling based on a reference ET, crop growth, yield, harvest index, and crop water productivity as affected by irrigation method, timing, amount (full or some degree of deficit), agronomic practices, cultivar, and weather. Prior publications have focused on alfalfa ET, comparisons with ""tall crop"" reference ET, crop coefficients, and crop water productivity. Crop coefficients have been used by ET networks. The data have utility for testing simulation models of crop ET, growth, and yield, and for studies of reference ET methods.</p>

"Growth and Yield Data for the Bushland, Texas, Soybean Datasets","<p>This dataset consists of growth and yield data for each season when soybean [<em>Glycine max</em> (L.) Merr.] was grown for seed at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU) research weather station, Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). In the 1994, 2003, 2004, and 2010 seasons, soybean was grown on two large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. In 2019, soybean was grown on four large, precision weighing lysimeters and their surrounding 4.4 ha fields. The square fields are themselves arranged in a larger square with four fields in four adjacent quadrants of the larger square. Fields and lysimeters within each field are thus designated northeast (NE), southeast (SE), northwest (NW), and southwest (SW). Soybean was grown on different combinations of fields in different years. Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system in 1995, 2003, 2004, and 2010 although in 2010 only one irrigation was applied to establish the crop after which it was grown as a dryland crop. Irrigation protocols described as full were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe to 2.4-m depth in the field. Irrigation protocols described as deficit typically involved irrigations to establish the crop early in the season, followed by reduced or absent irrigations later in the season (typically in the later winter and spring).<br />

"H3 Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Mandan, North Dakota","<p>H3 Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Mandan, North Dakota<br />
Greenhouse gas management and understanding the carbon emissions associated with land management decisions is a growing public concern and an increasingly important component to sustainable agricultural systems. Fertilization with nitrogen is known to influence emissions of greenhouse gases from soils. Less clear is how the timing of fertilization impacts emissions. We performed an experiment to determine if emissions could be reduced by adjustment of fertilization timing alone using a maize field in production. We found fertilization of plots with urea in the early-spring resulted in lower greenhouse gas emissions than fertilization of similar plots with urea in the late-spring. This was primarily due to greater emissions of carbon dioxide at the soil surface when fertilized at temperatures greater than 10°C. The difference between treatments, when integrated over a 5-month growing season, was 548 kg C ha-1. Yields were similar for both treatments. Fertilizing at cooler temperatures resulted in a substantial carbon “savings” without affecting yield. This study indicates fertilization timing may be a management option for reducing soil carbon losses and greenhouse gas emissions. Additional study is needed to determine if this effect is consistent across years.</p>

HIRO2,"<p>*** Please note: This software is no longer being updated or maintained, and is out of date. ***</p>
<p>HIRO2 (Hortonian Infiltration and Run-Off/On) is a spatially distributed rainfall-runoff model for event-based studies of space-time watershed processes. A grid-based routing hierarchy was defined over the watershed using the D-infinity contributing area algorithm. Computation of ponding time was included to handle variable run-on and rainfall intensity. The Green-Ampt model was adopted to calculate surface infiltration, and the kinematic wave model was used to route Hortonian runoff and channel flow. The model can handle input rainfall, soil parameters, surface roughness, and other properties that vary in space and time.</p>

HYDRUS,"<p>The HYDRUS program is a finite element model for simulating the one-dimensional movement of water, heat, and multiple solutes in variably saturated media. The program numerically solves the Richards' equation for saturated-unsaturated water flow and Fickian-based advection-dispersion equations for heat and solute transport. The flow equation incorporates a sink term to account for water uptake by plant roots. The heat transport equation considers conduction as well as convection with flowing water. The solute transport equations consider advective-dispersive transport in the liquid phase, and diffusion in the gaseous phase. The transport equations also include provisions for nonlinear and/or nonequilibrium reactions between the solid and liquid phases, linear equilibrium reactions between the liquid and gaseous phases, zero-order production, and two first-order degradation reactions: one which is independent of other solutes, and one which provides the coupling between solutes involved in sequential first-order decay reactions. The program may be used to analyze water and solute movement in unsaturated, partially saturated, or fully saturated porous media.</p>
<p>The flow region itself may be composed of nonuniform soils. Flow and transport can occur in the vertical, horizontal, or a generally inclined direction. The water flow part of the model can deal with (constant or time-varying) prescribed head and flux boundaries, boundaries controlled by atmospheric conditions, as well as free drainage boundary conditions. Soil surface boundary conditions may change during the simulation from prescribed flux to prescribed head type conditions (and vice-versa).</p>
<p>For solute transport the code supports both (constant and varying) prescribed concentration (Dirichlet or first-type) and concentration flux (Cauchy or third-type) boundary conditions. The dispersion coefficient includes terms reflecting the effects of molecular diffusion and tortuosity.</p>
<p>The unsaturated soil hydraulic properties are described using van Genuchten [1980], Brooks and Correy [1964] and modified van Genuchten type analytical functions. Modifications were made to improve the description of hydraulic properties near saturation. The HYDRUS code incorporates hysteresis by using the empirical model introduced by Scott et al. [1983] and Kool and Parker [1987]. This model assumes that drying scanning curves are scaled from the main drying curve, and wetting scanning curves from the main wetting curve. HYDRUS also implements a scaling procedure to approximate hydraulic variability in a given soil profile by means of a set of linear scaling transformations which relate the individual soil hydraulic characteristics to those of a reference soil.</p>
<p>Root growth is simulated by means of a logistic growth function. Water and salinity stress response functions can be defined according to functions proposed by Feddes et al. [1978] or van Genuchten [1987].</p>
<p>The governing flow and transport equations are solved numerically using Galerkin type linear finite element schemes. Integration in time is achieved using an implicit (backwards) finite difference scheme for both saturated and unsaturated conditions. Additional measures are taken to improve solution efficiency for transient problems, including automatic time step adjustment and adherence to preset ranges of the Courant and Peclet numbers. The water content term is evaluated using the mass-conservative method proposed by Celia et al. [1990]. Possible options for minimizing numerical oscillations in the transport solutions include upstream weighing, artificial dispersion, and/or performance indexing.</p>

<p>Atrazine concentrations in Goodwater Creek Experimental Watershed (GCEW) were shown to be among the very highest of any watershed in the United States based on comparisons using the national Watershed Regressions for Pesticides (WARP) model and by direct comparison with the 112 watersheds used in the development of WARP. The herbicide data collected in GCEW are documented at plot, field, and watershed scales. This 20-yr-long (1991-2010) effort was augmented with a spatially broad effort within the Central Mississippi River Basin encompassing 12 related claypan watersheds in the Salt River Basin, two cave streams on the fringe of the Central Claypan Areas in the Bonne Femme watershed, and 95 streams in northern Missouri and southern Iowa. The research effort on herbicide transport has highlighted the importance of restrictive soil layers with smectitic mineralogy to the risk of transport vulnerability. Near-surface soil features, such as claypans and argillic horizons, result in greater herbicide transport than soils with high saturated hydraulic conductivities and low smectitic clay content.</p>

"High efficiency Nitrogen Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Fort Collins, Colorado","<p>High efficiency Nitrogen Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Fort Collins, Colorado<br />
Nitrogen fertilization is essential for optimizing crop yields; however, it increases N2O emissions. The study objective was to compare N2O emissions resulting from application of commercially available enhanced-efficiency N fertilizers with emissions from conventional dry granular urea in irrigated cropping systems. These emissions were monitored from several irrigated cropping systems receiving N fertilizer rates ranging from 0-202 kg/ha years 2009-2011. Fertilizer types include Urea, UAN, SuperU (N inhibitor), ESN(slow release). In 2009, we eliminated the conventional tillage treatment.  Cropping systems from 2009-2011 included a more conservative strip-till continuous corn (ST-CC) rotation and a no-till continuous corn (NT-CC) rotation.  We also tested different fertilizer placements, including broadcast (bc), surface banded (bd) sub-surface banded (ssb) N inputs. Nitrous oxide fluxes were measured during these three growing seasons using static, vented chambers and a gas chromatograph analyzer.  This work shows that the use of no-till and enhanced-efficiency N fertilizers can potentially reduce N2O emissions from irrigated systems.</p>

HoloBee Database v2016.1,"<p>Organisms living in honey bees and honey bee colonies form large associative holobiont communities that are integral to bee biology.  High-throughput sequencing approaches to characterize these holobiont communities from honey bees in various states of health and disease are now commonplace, producing large amounts of nucleotide sequence data that must be accurately and consistently analyzed in order to produce reliable and comparable reports.  In addition, new species designations and revisions are actively being made from honey bee holobiont communities, complicating nomenclature in larger databases where taxonomic descriptions associated with archived sequences can quickly become outdated and misleading.</p>
<p>To improve the accuracy and consistency of honey bee holobiont research, we have developed HoloBee: a curated database of publicly accessioned nucleotide sequences from the honey bee holobiont community.  Except in rare and noted exceptions made by curators, sequences used in HoloBee were obtained from, or in association with, <em>Apis mellifera</em> (Western honey bee) as well as other honey bee species where available (e.g. <em>Apis cerana</em>, <em>Apis dorsata</em>, <em>Apis laboriosa</em>, <em>Apis koschevnikovi</em>, <em>Apis florea</em>, <em>Apis andreniformis</em> and <em>Apis nigrocincta</em>).  Sources include:  within or on the surface of honey bees (adult, pupae, larvae, egg), corbicular pollen, bee bread, royal jelly, honey, comb, hive surfaces (e.g. bottom board debris, frames, landing platforms), and isolates of microbes, parasites and pathogens from honey bees.  HoloBee contains two non-overlapping sets of sequence data, HoloBee-Barcode and HoloBee-Mop, each of which have distinct intended uses.</p>
<p><strong>HoloBee-Barcode</strong> is a non-redundant database of taxonomically informative barcoding loci for all viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoans and metazoans associated with honey bees (<em>Apis</em> spp.).  It was created from an exhaustive master sequence archive of all valid holobiont sequences.  Redundancy was removed from this master archive using a clustering algorithm that grouped sequences with ≥ 99% identity and retained the longest sequence from each cluster as the representative accession for that sequence type (“centroid”).  These centroid sequences were concatenated into a fasta formatted file to create the HoloBee-Barcode database.  Associated taxonomy for each centroid, including Superkingdom through Species and Strain/Isolate, was individually reviewed and corrected when necessary by a curator.  Cross reference tables (separated according to 5 major taxonomic groups) provide a user-friendly outline of information for each centroid accession within HoloBee-Barcode including taxonomy, gene/product name, sequence length, the unaltered NCBI definition line, the number and identity of redundant sequences clustered within each centroid, and any additional information provided by the curator.  HoloBee-Barcode centroid counts are: Viruses = 86; Bacteria = 496; Fungi = 41; Protozoa = 4; Metazoa = 60.</p>
<p>HoloBee-Barcode is intended to improve and standardize quantitative and qualitative metagenomic descriptions of holobiont communities associated with honey bees by providing a curated set of barcode sequences.  The goal of genetic barcoding is to associate a nucleotide sequence sample to a taxonomically valid species.  Genomic regions targeted for such barcoding purposes varied by taxonomic group.  The small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA, or 16S rRNA, is the most commonly used barcode for bacteria and is used in HB-Barcode.  These 16S rRNA sequences will support the analysis of data generated with the widely used approach of amplicon-based 16S rRNA deep sequencing to study microbiota communities.  Although barcode markers for fungi are less definitive than bacteria, HB-Barcode defaults to the ribosomal RNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), which typically includes ITS-1, 5.8S, and ITS-2.  For some clades that cannot be resolved by this region, other barcode markers were selected.  The majority of barcodes for metazoan taxa are the mitochondrial locus cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI).  Complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence for <em>Apis cerana</em> (Asian honey bee) and <em>Galleria mellonella</em> (Greater wax moth) are included as barcodes for these species.  We note that <em>A. cerana</em> mtDNA is included because it is considered a potentially invasive honey bee species and monitoring for its occurrence is in practice regionally, including in Australia, New Zealand and the USA.  Protozoan barcodes include cytochrome b oxidase (Cytb), SSU, or ITS while entire genomes are used for viral barcoding.</p>
<p><strong>HoloBee-Mop</strong> is a database comprised mostly of chromosomal, mitochondrial and plasmid genome assemblies in order to aggregate as much honey bee holobiont genomic sequence information as possible.  For a few organisms without genome assembly data, transcriptome data are included (e.g. <em>Aethina tumida</em>, small hive beetle).  Unlike HoloBee-Barcode, redundancy removal was not performed on the HoloBee-Mop database and thus this resource provides an archive of nucleotide sequence assemblies from honey bee holobionts.  However, since full viral genomes are used in HoloBee-Barcode, only redundant viral sequences occur in HoloBee-Mop.  All accessions within each of these assemblies were concatenated into a single fasta formatted file to create the HoloBee-Mop database.  The intended purpose of HoloBee-Mop is to improve honey bee genome and transcriptome assemblies by “mopping-up” as much viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan and non-honey bee metazoan sequence data as possible.  Therefore, sequence data remaining after processing reads through both HoloBee-Barcode and HoloBee-Mop that do not map to the honey bee genome may contain unique data from taxonomic variants or novel species.  Details for each sequence assembly within HoloBee-Mop are tabulated in cross reference tables according to each major taxonomic group.  HoloBee-Mop assembly counts are: Viruses = 2; Bacteria = 55; Fungi = 5; Protozoa = 1; Metazoa = 6.</p>

Homalodisca vitripennis Genome Assembly 1.0,"<p>The Baylor College of Medicine recently sequenced and annotated the <em>Homalodisca vitripennis</em> genome as part of the i5k pilot project.</p>
<p>The Glassy-winged sharpshooter, GWSS, (<em>Homalodisca vitripennis</em>) [Hemiptera: Cicadellidae], occurs naturally within the southern United States. Once restricted to the southeastern states, it was accidentally spread across the south into California. The GWSS is a voracious feeder, and can fly long distances, preferring to feed upon cultivated crops, ie. Grapevine, fruit trees, and in the nymphal stages many weeds and grasses.</p>
<p>The GWSS is a serious threat to the viticulture industry as the primary vector of the plant-infecting bacterium, <em>Xylella fastidiosa</em>, Xf. The GWSS feeds on a diverse number of plants, during which the bacteria can infect many tree fruit, nut, vine, and woody ornamental crops.</p>
<p>Glassy-winged Sharpshooter adults are ½ inch (13mm) long being fairly large for the Sharpshooter leafhopper family of insects. Sharpshooters use an ovipositor to lay eggs inside of the underside of leaves. The Sharpshooter will lay its eggs on almost any plant including cactus. The egg masses are usually composed of 10-20 eggs, but can lay more or as few as 1. Most of the egg masses have a waxy coating of brocosomes around the eggs for protection. The nymphs (5 instars) do not have wings, but develop wing pads in the 5th instar and are generally smaller than the adults, ranging in size from .07 inches (2 mm) to nearly ½ inch (13mm) long. The nymphs have very distinct red eyes. The Sharpshooter can consume about 300 times its own weight in fluids from the xylem vessels of the plants upon which it feeds, thus producing copious amounts of excreta fluid.</p>

IncA-C Alignment,"<p>IncA/C plasmids are a class of plasmids from Enterobacteraciae that are relatively large (49 to &gt;180 kbp), are readily transferred by conjugation, and carry multiple antimicrobial resistance genes. Reconstruction of the phylogeny of these plasmids has been difficult because of the high rate of remodeling by recombination-mediated horizontal gene transfer (HGT). We hypothesized that evaluation of nucleotide polymorphisms relative to the rate of HGT would help to develop a clock to show if anthropic practices have had significant influences on the lineages of the plasmid. A system was developed to rapidly sequence up to 191 known open27 reading-frames from each of 39 recently isolated IncA/C plasmids from a diverse panel of Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli. With these data plus sequences from Genbank we were able to distinguish six distinct lineages that had extremely low numbers of polymorphisms within each lineage, especially among the largest group designated as Lineage 1. Two regions, each about half the plasmid in size, could be distinguished with a separate lineal pattern. The distribution of Lineage 1 showed that it has migrated extremely rapidly with fewer polymorphisms than can be expected in two-thousand years. Remodeling by frequent HGT was evident with a pattern that appeared to have the highest rate just upstream of the putative conjugation origin of transfer (ori-T). It seems likely that when an IncA/C plasmid is transferred also adjacent to a multiple antimicrobial resistance gene cassette.</p>

Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM),"<p>The need for a research tool that integrates the many physical and biological processes on a farm has led to the development of the Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM). The model has been used to evaluate a wide variety of technologies and management strategies, and these analyses have been reported in the scientific and farm-trade literature. Systems research in dairy and beef production remains as the primary purpose of this tool, but the model also provides an effective teaching aid. With the model, students gain a better appreciation for the complexity of livestock forage systems. The learn how small changes affect many parts of the system, causing unanticipated results. They may also use the model to develop a more optimum food production system. When used in extension type teaching, producers can learn more about their farms and obtain information useful in strategic planning. By testing and comparing different options with the model, those offering the greatest economic benefit with acceptable environmental impact can be found.</p>
<p>Input information is supplied to the program through three parameter files. The farm parameter file contains data describing the farm such as crop areas, soil type, equipment and structures used, numbers of animals at various ages, harvest, tillage, and manure handling strategies, and prices for various farm inputs and outputs. The machinery file includes parameters for each machine available for use on a simulated farm.</p>
<p>Simulation output is available in four files, which contain summary tables, report tables, optional tables, and parameter tables. The summary tables provide average performance, environmental impact, costs, and returns for the years simulated. These values consist of crop yields, feeds produced, feeds bought and sold, manure produced, nutrient losses to the environment, production costs, income from products sold, and the net return or profitability of the farm. Values are provided for the average and standard deviation of each over all simulated years. The report tables provide extensive output information including all the data given in the summary tables. In these tables, values are given for each simulated year of weather as well as the mean and variance over all simulated years. Optional tables are available for a closer inspection of how the components of the full simulation are functioning. These tables include very detailed data, often on a daily basis. Parameter tables summarize the input parameters specified for a given simulation. These tables provide a convenient method of documenting the parameter settings used for a simulation.</p>

"International Climate Benchmarks and Input Parameters for a Stochastic Weather Generator, CLIGEN","<p>This dataset represents CLIGEN input parameters for locations in 68 countries. CLIGEN is a point-scale stochastic weather generator that produces long-term weather simulations with daily output. The input parameters are essentially monthly climate statistics that also serve as climate benchmarks. Three unique input parameter sets are differentiated by having been produced from 30-year, 20-year and 10-year minimum record lengths that correspond to 7673, 2336, and 2694 stations, respectively. The primary source of data is the NOAA GHCN-Daily dataset, and due to data gaps, records longer than the three minimum record lengths were often queried to produce the needed number of complete monthly records. The vast majority of stations used at least some data from the 2000&#039;s, and temporal coverages are shown in the Excel table for each station. CLIGEN has various applications including being used to force soil erosion models. This dataset may reduce the effort needed in preparing climate inputs for such applications.</p>

Inventory of online public databases and repositories holding agricultural data in 2017,"<p>United States agricultural researchers have many options for making their data available online. This dataset aggregates the primary sources of ag-related data and determines where researchers are likely to deposit their agricultural data. These data serve as both a current landscape analysis and also as a baseline for future studies of ag research data.</p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>As sources of agricultural data become more numerous and disparate, and collaboration and open data become more expected if not required, this research provides a landscape inventory of online sources of open agricultural data.</p>
<p>An inventory of current agricultural data sharing options will help assess how the <a href=""https://data.nal.usda.gov"">Ag Data Commons</a>, a platform for USDA-funded data cataloging and publication, can best support data-intensive and multi-disciplinary research. It will also help agricultural librarians assist their researchers in data management and publication. The goals of this study were to</p>
<ul>
<li>establish where agricultural researchers in the United States-- land grant and USDA researchers, primarily ARS, NRCS, USFS and other agencies -- currently publish their data, including general research data repositories, domain-specific databases, and the top journals</li>
<li>compare how much data is in institutional vs. domain-specific vs. federal platforms</li>
<li>determine which repositories are recommended by top journals that require or recommend the publication of supporting data</li>
<li>ascertain where researchers not affiliated with funding or initiatives possessing a designated open data repository can publish data</li>
</ul>
<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>The National Agricultural Library team focused on Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and United States Forest Service (USFS) style research data, rather than ag economics, statistics, and social sciences data. To find domain-specific, general, institutional, and federal agency repositories and databases that are open to US research submissions and have some amount of ag data, resources including re3data, libguides, and ARS lists were analysed. Primarily environmental or public health databases were not included, but places where ag grantees would publish data were considered.</p>
<h3>Search methods</h3>
<p>We first compiled a list of known domain specific USDA / ARS datasets / databases that are represented in the Ag Data Commons, including ARS Image Gallery, ARS Nutrition Databases (sub-components), SoyBase, PeanutBase, National Fungus Collection, i5K Workspace @ NAL, and GRIN. We then searched using search engines such as Bing and Google for non-USDA / federal ag databases, using Boolean variations of “agricultural data” /“ag data” / “scientific data” + NOT + USDA (to filter out the federal / USDA results). Most of these results were domain specific, though some contained a mix of data subjects.</p>
<p>We then used search engines such as Bing and Google to find top agricultural university repositories using variations of “agriculture”, “ag data” and “university” to find schools with agriculture programs. Using that list of universities, we searched each university web site to see if their institution had a repository for their unique, independent research data if not apparent in the initial web browser search. We found both ag specific university repositories and general university repositories that housed a portion of agricultural data. Ag specific university repositories are included in the list of domain-specific repositories. Results included Columbia University – International Research Institute for Climate and Society, UC Davis – Cover Crops Database, etc. If a general university repository existed, we determined whether that repository could filter to include only data results after our chosen ag search terms were applied. General university databases that contain ag data included Colorado State University Digital Collections, University of Michigan ICPSR (Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research), and University of Minnesota DRUM (Digital Repository of the University of Minnesota). We then split out NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) repositories.</p>
<p>Next we searched the internet for open general data repositories using a variety of search engines, and repositories containing a mix of data, journals, books, and other types of records were tested to determine whether that repository could filter for data results after search terms were applied. General subject data repositories include Figshare, Open Science Framework, PANGEA, Protein Data Bank, and Zenodo.</p>
<p>Finally, we compared scholarly journal suggestions for data repositories against our list to fill in any missing repositories that might contain agricultural data. Extensive lists of journals were compiled, in which USDA published in 2012 and 2016, combining search results in ARIS, Scopus, and the Forest Service's TreeSearch, plus the USDA web sites  Economic Research Service (ERS), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS), Food and Nutrition Service (FNS),  Rural Development (RD), and Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). The top 50 journals' author instructions were consulted to see if they (a) ask or require submitters to provide supplemental data, or (b) require submitters to submit data to open repositories.</p>
<p>Data are provided for Journals based on a 2012 and 2016 study of where USDA employees publish their research studies, ranked by number of articles, including 2015/2016 Impact Factor, Author guidelines, Supplemental Data?, Supplemental Data reviewed?, Open Data (Supplemental or in Repository) Required? and Recommended data repositories, as provided in the online author guidelines for each the top 50 journals.</p>
<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>We ran a series of searches on all resulting general subject databases with the designated search terms. From the results, we noted the total number of datasets in the repository, type of resource searched (datasets, data, images, components, etc.), percentage of the total database that each term comprised, any dataset with a search term that comprised at least 1% and 5% of the total collection, and any search term that returned greater than 100 and greater than 500 results.</p>
<p>We compared domain-specific databases and repositories based on parent organization, type of institution, and whether data submissions were dependent on conditions such as funding or affiliation of some kind.</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>A summary of the major findings from our data review:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over half of the top 50 ag-related journals from our profile require or encourage open data for their published authors.</li>
<li>There are few general repositories that are both large AND contain a significant portion of ag data in their collection. GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), ICPSR, and ORNL DAAC were among those that had over 500 datasets returned with at least one ag search term and had that result comprise at least 5% of the total collection.</li>
<li>Not even one quarter of the domain-specific repositories and datasets reviewed allow open submission by any researcher regardless of funding or affiliation.</li>
</ul>

"Irrigation Residue Removal Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network and Resilient Economic Agricultural Practices in Lincoln, Nebraska","<p>Irrigation Residue Removal Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network and Resilient Economic Agricultural Practices in Lincoln, Nebraska<br />
USDA-ARS REAP Study (Ithaca, NE) - NEMEIRR Sustainable intensification of high-yielding production systems may help meet increasing demands for food, fuel, and fiber worldwide. Specifically, corn stover is being removed by producers for livestock purposes, and stover is also targeted as a primary 2nd generation biofuel feedstock. The NEMEIRR experimental objectives are to quantify how stover removal (no removal, moderate removal, high removal) and tillage management (no-till, disk) affect crop yields, soil organic carbon, soil greenhouse gas emissions, and other soil responses (microbial community structure, function; soil health). This experiment is conducted in a fully irrigated continuous corn system in the western Corn Belt, and soil and plant measurements have been taken since study establishment in 2001.  By: V.L. Jin (1 Sep 2016).  (41 9 43.3 N. 96 14 41.4 W; 349 m asl). Thc soil is Tomck silt loam (a fine, smectitic. mesic Pachic Argiudoll) and Filbert silt loam (a fine, smectitie. mesie Verne Argialboll). Long-term (1981-2010) mean annual precipitation is 74 cm and tempera¬ture is 9.8°C The study has been in continuous corn since 2000. Thc experimental design is a randomized complete block with factorial treatments arranged in split plots. The whole-plot factor is tillage treatment (NT or CT) and the subplot factor is none (0%). medium (•35%). and high (40%) stover removal calcu¬lated on a mass basis. Nitrogen fertilizer was applied at 202 kg N ha-I yr I in 2001. 2002. 2004. 2007. 2008. 2009, and 2010.190 kg N hi t yr-I in 2003. and 168 kg N ha 1 yr- I in 2005 and 2006. Treatments (tillage) and subplot treatments (residue re¬moval levels) were randomly assigned in a factorial arrangement to whole-plot experimental units (9 by 45.6 m) and subplots within the whole plots (9 by 15.2 m) in six blocks.  The previous crop for the entire area in 2000 was corn under rainfcd conditions. Before 2000. the study site was historically cropped with corn, soybean [Glycinc max (L.) Merr.). oat (Arena JoIliM L.), and alfalfa (Maid-ago saliva L). In the spring of 2001, residue was removed from the medium and high stover removal treatments using a flail chopper. The entire study was then disked to remove ridges formed during the previous crop year. In each successive year of the study, only the disk treatment area was tilled to a depth of 15 to 20 cm. usually in the spring before plant¬ing. Irrigation was conducted with a solid set sprinkler system in 2001, then supplemental water applications from 2002 to 2010 were made using a linear-move irrigation system. Irrigation treat¬ments were applied when deemed necessary, with annual rates averaging 12.5 ± 7.0 cm from 2001-2010 (Table I).  Glyphosatc-tolerant corn hybrids adapted to eastern Nebraska have been used throughout the study. Corn was plant¬ed with a six-row planter in 76-cm rows at a rate *174.000 viable seeds ha 1, typically during the first week of May. Weed control was accomplished using glyphosate EN-(phosphonomethyl)gly¬eine] and atrazine (6.chloro-N-ethyl-AP-(1-methylethyl)-1.3.5- triazine-2.4-diamine) applications along with in-season cultiva.</p>

KINEROS - The kinematic runoff and erosion model,"<p>The kinematic runoff and erosion model KINEROS is an event oriented, physically based model describing the processes of interception, infiltration, surface runoff and erosion from small agricultural and urban watersheds. The watershed is represented by a cascade of planes and channels; the partial differential equations describing overland flow, channel flow, erosion and sediment transport are solved by finite difference techniques.  The spatial variation of rainfall, infiltration, runoff, and erosion parameters can be accomodated.  KINEROS may be used to determine the effects of various artificial features such as urban developments, small detention reservoirs, or lined channels on flood hydrographs and sediment yield.</p>

Dataset also includes the nutritive value of Kentucky bluegrass throughout the season. Dataset can be used for modeling or for grazing planning. Some plots were mowed before the growing season to simulate early defoliation.</p>
<p>Sampling occurred at the USDA Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory near Mandan, ND (46.7673 N, 100.9184 W) The 6-hectare pasture is at an altitude of 502 m above sea level and is within the temperate steppe ecoregion of the United States. This region is characterized by long, cold winters and short, hot summers. Predominant soil types include Temvik-Wilton silt loams (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic and Pachic Haplustolls). The pasture is on a loamy ecological site (site ID 054XY030ND) and is managed as a native grassland with no fertilization or irrigation. The average soil texture is a clay loam (31% clay, 49% silt, and 20% sand). Average soil chemical characteristics were: pH (H2O) = 6.4; OM = 7.4% LOI; Na (ppm) = 8.25; K (ppm) = 362.4; Ca (ppm) = 1925.4; Mg (mmolc/dm3) = 417.6; CEC (me/100 g) = 17.5; S (ppm) = 8.3; Cu (ppm) = 0.74; Fe (ppm) = 33.7; Mn (ppm) = 18.5; and Zn (ppm) = 9.7.</p>

Key Foods,"<p>The Nutrient Data Laboratory is responsible for developing authoritative nutrient databases that contain a wide range of food composition values of the nation's food supply. This requires updating and revising the USDA Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR) and developing various special interest databases. However, with over 7,000 food items in SR and a complete nutrient profile costing approximately $2,000 for one sample, analyzing every food item for every nutrient and meeting all user requirements is impossible. Consequently, priorities must be determined. Procedures using food consumption data and nutrient values for developing the Key Foods list are explained. Key Foods have been identified as those food items that contribute up to 75% of any one nutrient to the dietary intake of the US population.  These Key Foods will be used to set priorities for nutrient analyses under the National Food and Nutrient Analysis Program. The tables describe key foods based on Continuing Survey Of Food Intakes By Individuals (CSFII, 1989-) and WWEIA-NHANES (What We Eat In America - National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-) survey data.</p>

LTAR Upper Mississippi River Basin - Morris - Swan Lake Research Farm Phenocam,"<p>The PhenoCam network is collecting color and near infrared images year-round using cameras in fixed positions on agricultural lands including a site located on the Swan Lake Research Farm. The network effort was initiated in 2015 at this long-term, plot-scale research site. The camera at the research farm on focused a plot-scale, replicated research study that was established in 1997 to assess the long-term impacts of various tillage management options on soil organic carbon. Initially the study included eight tillage treatments: no-tillage, moldboard + disk tillage, chisel tillage, and fall and spring residue management, with or without strip-tillage and strip-tillage + sub-soiling. In 2004, the number of treatments were reduced to no-tillage, moldboard tillage, and fall and spring residue management without strip-tillage. All tillage treatments also had an early or late planting date. In 2008, the strip-tillage plots were modified to explore alternative strategies for supporting cellulosic bioenergy feedstock production, including planting of cellulosic feedstock.  The modification included adding perennials grasses into an extended 6-year rotation, winter cereal rye cover crops in a corn-soybean rotation, and an alternative Sorghum-Sudan grass hybrid forage system. Detailed soil and crop properties data have been collected from this site.

LTAR Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed DAP GIS Layers,"<p>The USDA-ARS Southwest Watershed Research Center (SWRC) operates the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) in southeastern Arizona as an outdoor laboratory for studying semiarid rangeland hydrologic, ecosystem, climate, and erosion processes.</p>
<p>Since its establishment in 1953, the SWRC in Tucson, Arizona, has collected, processed, managed, and disseminated high-resolution, spatially distributed hydrologic data in support of the center’s mission. Data management at the SWRC has evolved through time in response to new computing, storage, and data access technologies. In 1996, the SWRC initiated a multiyear project to upgrade rainfall and runoff sensors and convert analog systems to digital electronic systems supported by data loggers. This conversion was coupled with radio telemetry to remotely transmit recorded data to a central computer, thus greatly reducing operational overhead by reducing labor, maintenance, and data processing time. A concurrent effort was initiated to improve access to SWRC data by creating a system based on a relational database supporting access to the data via the Internet. An SWRC team made up of scientists, IT specialists, programmers, hydrologic technicians, and instrumentation specialists was formed. This effort is termed the Southwest Watershed Research Center Data Access Project (DAP).</p>
<p>The goal of the SWRC DAP is to efficiently disseminate data to researchers; land owners, users, and managers; and to the public. Primary access to the data is provided through a Web-based user interface. In addition, data can be accessed directly from within the SWRC network. The first priority for the DAP was to assimilate and make available rainfall and runoff data collected from two instrumented field sites, the WGEW near Tombstone, Arizona, and the Santa Rita Experimental Range (SRER) south of Tucson, Arizona.</p>
<p>This web map describes the associated GIS layers.</p>

"Leaf litter cover data on 1m x 1m plots from the long-term Small Mammal Exclusion Study (SMES) at Jornada Basin LTER, 1995-2015","<p>This data package contains leaf litter cover data from plots with various levels of herbivore exclusion on the Jornada Experimental Range. Study sites were established in 1995; one in black grama grassland and the other in creosotebush shrubland to compare the impact of herbivores on ecosystem processes between these vegetation types. Parallel studies were established at the Sevilleta LTER site (New Mexico, USA) and Mapimi Biosphere Reserve (Durango, Mexico). Each study site is 1 km by 0.5 km in area. Four replicate experimental blocks were randomly located at the grassland study site to measure vegetation responses using exclusion treatments including a) all mammalian herbivores, including cattle, lagomorphs, and rodents, b) lagomorphs and cattle only, c) cattle only, and d) control accessible to all herbivores. Because grazing cattle are excluded from the entire creosote site, only three replicate experimental blocks were randomly located there including a) all mammalian herbivores, including lagomorphs, and rodents, b) lagomorphs only, and c) control accessible to all herbivores. Thirty-six sampling points were positioned at 5.8-meter intervals on a systematically located 6 by 6 point grid within each plot. A permanent one-meter by one-meter vegetation measurement quadrat is located at each of the 36 points. Each year in spring and fall from 1995-2005, the total percent cover of leaf litter in each quadrat was estimated by summing the percent of each 10 cm square within a quadrat (including 100 10-cm squares) containing leaf litter (See methods for a detailed explanation). After 2005, sampling frequency changed to every 5 years. This study is ongoing.</p>

<p>The Colorado potato beetle is considered the economically most significant defoliator of potato in northern latitudes worldwide. The range of this insect is continuing to expand, and it is likely to eventually colonize all potato-producing areas with temperate climate. Within it's native habitat, the beetle feeds on native solanaceous plants, <i>S. angustifolium, S. elaeagnifolium</i>, and buffalo bur, <i>S. rostratum</i>. However, it has adapted to potatoes and other solanaceous crops after its range expansion.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of any natural enemies that have been able to evolve seasonal adaptations, the cornerstone of Colorado potato beetle management has been the use of insecticides. However, the beetle has shown a remarkable ability to develop resistance to most insecticides used for its control. The mechanism(s) of insecticide resistance is yet unknown and genomic sequencing will lead to major advances in managing this pest in commercial plant production.</p>

"Little Washita River Experimental Watershed, Oklahoma (Flow)","<p>Over the past five decades, the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) have collected stream flow, reservoir, and groundwater data in the Fort Cobb Reservoir Experimental Watershed (FCREW) and Southern Great Plains Research Watershed (SGPRW), which includes the Little Washita River Experimental Watershed (LWREW) in central Oklahoma. The climate in these watersheds is subhumid, with average annual rainfall of 800 mm (1971-2000 average for Caddo County; Oklahoma Climatology Survey, 2005). The drainage area of the SGPRW is 2927 km2 and includes the LWREW. The LWREW covers an area of 610 km2 and consists of mixed agricultural land use, mainly pasture and rangeland that covers 68% of the total area. The topography is rolling with a maximum relief of 180 m and sandy to loamy soils. Of the 13 USGS stream gauges in the LWREW, two of them, ARS 522 and ARS 526, were initially managed by the USDA-ARS but decommissioned in 1985. Gauge ARS 522 was colocated with the USGS stream gauge ID 7327490, and data from this gauge were used when ARS 522 was discontinued. In 1992, the USGS installed the stream gauge ID 7327447 at the same location (Little Washita River near Cement, OK) where ARS 526 existed. For the stream gauges ID 522 and 526 installed by the ARS, stream stage data were obtained using a Hg manometer bubble gauge and a continuous stage recorder. Periodic stream discharge measurements were made during rain events and low-flow periods to define the relationship between flow discharge and stage. Discharge data by time increments were computed from the stage charts by the stage shift method (Corbett, 1943; Brakensiek et al., 1979). The directly measured data are the stage, which is then used to estimate discharge using stage-discharge relationships.  All measurements made at USGS gaging stations are quality assured and quality controlled. The equipment used to make the measurements is securely housed and regularly checked for calibration and drift. Current meters are spin tested before use and checked after use if the measured value is deemed questionable.</p>

"Long-Term Agroecosystem Research Network regions, 2018 version","<p>The Long-Term Agroecosystem Research Network, consisting of 18+ research locations, is conducting research on the sustainable intensification of agroecosystems. To enable coordinated network level research, a spatial framework is required to facilitate analysis. However, no suitable spatial framework currently exists to meet the needs for the LTAR Network. To develop a framework for analysis the LTAR Network initiated the Regionalization Project. Goals also included providing a standardized spatial footprint for LTAR cross-site investigations, estimating the confidence with which results from research plots and fields could reasonably be extrapolated to ""represented regions"", informing decisions about where additional research sites should be prioritized and facilitating public outreach of the LTAR Network. To address these goals a workshop was held in 2018 resulting in the production of three sets of regional boundaries in a geographic information system (GIS). These GIS datasets are intended to be used for mapping the<br />
network and for summarizing spatial data relevant to domains of sustainable intensification corresponding with agricultural production, environmental impact, and rural prosperity. This resulted in a geodatabase of three new maps describing regional boundaries for the LTAR Network titled ""Long-Term Agroecosystem Research Network regions, 2018 version"", archived in the USDA National Agricultural Library's Ag Data Commons repository.</p>

"Long-term Crop Rotation Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Lincoln, Nebraska","<p>Long-term Crop Rotation Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Lincoln, Nebraska<br />
Lincoln NE Long-term Crop Rotation Project Overview of NEMLTCRS: Long-term Crop Rotation Study (Ithaca, NE) Crop rotation and fertilizer N management are common practices that affect productivity and input use efficiency. Evaluating these practices in a long-term setting provides the opportunity to assess their influence across a wide range of growing conditions and to determine their effect on yield stability (performance across a wide range of environmental conditions). Previous publications from this experiment have evaluated the response of corn, soybean, and sorghum production to these treatments under conventional tillage during an earlier time period (e.g., Peterson and Varvel, 1989a,b,c; Varvel, 2000), concluding that diversified crop rotations generally enhance grain production. Following conversion to no-till, yield trends from 2007 to 2013 indicate that: • Diversified 2- and 4-yr crop rotations increased corn and grain sorghum yields. • Corn and grain sorghum grain yields in 2- and 4-yr rotations were more resilient to variable growing conditions.• Soybean was less sensitive than corn and grain sorghum to crop rotation. Excerpted from: Sindelar et al., 2016 (Agron. J. 108: 1592-1602) viewed as an unfassirable management practice in soybean because it can inhibit  nodular:ion (Salvagiotti et aL. 2008). However. responses to early-season fertilizer N are inconsistent. For example. Varvd and Peterson (1992) reported a decrease with fertilizer N input. yet Osborne and Riedell (2006) reported a grain yield increase with fertilizer N addition. Therefore. additional work is needed to clarify this particular response of soybean to early-season N fenilization. Crop rotation and fertilizer N management arc common practices that affect productivity and input use efficiency. Evaluating these practices in a long-term setting provides the opportunity to assess their influence across a wide range of growing conditions and to determine their effect on yield stability (performance across a wide range of environmental conditions). Previous publications from this experiment have evaluated the response acorn. soybean. and sorghum produc-tion to these treatments under conventional tillage during an earlier time period (e.g.. Peterson and VarveL 1989a.b.c: Varvel. 2000). concluding that diversified crop rotations gener-ally enhance grain production. Information has not yet been reported from this study naluacing the treatments under no-till (2007-2013). To our knowledge. no studies have simul-taneously evaluated the stability of continuous and diversified rotations of corn. grain sorghum. and soybean. The objective of this study was to evaluate long-term yield performance. yield stability. and fertilizer N of corn. grain sorghum. and soybean as affected by crop rotation and fertilizer N under no-till in the western Corn Belt. MATERIALS AND METHODS A field experiment was established in 1972 on a Yuan silty clay loam-Tomek salt barn compkx (fine-silty. mired. supaac-tire. mesic Mollie Hapkidalfs and fine. smecutic. mimic Pachic Argiudolls. resik.l.didy) near Ithaca. NE (31•10'N. 96'25'W). Elevation of the site is 366 rn. and mean annual temperature and precipitation arc 10.5*C and 765 mm. respectively. In-season air temperature. soil temperature. precipitation. and open pan evaporation measured on-site during this time period arc shown in Tabk I. The experiment was a randomized complete block design in a split plot arrangement with five replications. Crop rotation was the main ploc, and fertilizer N rate was the split plot. Crop rotations included continuous crops (continuous corn (CC). continuous grain sorghum IGGI. and continuous soybean (SS]). 2-yr (CS and OS) and 4-yr crop rotations (corn-soybean-grain sorghum-ad/clover vocation ((:5C01 and corn-cut/clover - grain sorghum-soybean rotation (COGS]). Continuous rota-tions that also included a fallow treatment were established in 1972 (with three replications). In 1983. the 2- and 4-yr rotation treatments were added. fallow treaunenrs were dropped. and the experiment was expanded to five replications. For the 4-yr rota-tions, all crops were present in the roudon, but the sequences differed. Each phase of every crop rotation was present each year. Fertilizer N treatments were initiated in 1984 and included 0. 90. and 180 kg N ha-1 for corn and grain sorghum and 0.34. and 69 kg N ha-I for soybean and oat/clover. Split plots were 9 m wide (76-an nivrs.n = 12) and 10 m king. The study was annu-ally disked mice in the spring from 1983 until 2006. In 2007. the study was converted to no-till.Agronomy Journal • Volume 108. Issue 4 • 2016 1593.</p>

Lincoln NE Long-term Tillage Project Overview of NELITCSE: Long-term Tillage and Cropping System Experiment (Lincoln, NE) The objectives of this experiment is to evaluate the agronomic and environmental impacts of long-term tillage and crop rotation practices in a rainfed agroecosystem. This experiment was initiated in 1981 with continuous corn only under six tillage practices (chisel, tandem disk, moldboard plow, no-till, ridge-tillage, and subsoil tillage). In 1985, the experimental design was modified to include 3 crop rotation systems (continuous corn, corn-soybean, and continuous soybean) under 6 tillage practices. Each year, both the corn phase and soybean phase of the two-year rotation system are present. In 2015, all tillage practices were converted to no-till to evaluate the magnitude, direction, and rate of agronomic and soil changes to this management shift. In addition, the continuous soybean system was converted to continuous corn with a 3-species winter cover crop (hairy vetch, purple-topped radish, and cereal rye). Prepared 13 Sep 2016 (V. Jin)</p>

MTGSAM: Multiple-Trait Gibbs Sampler for Animal Models,"<p>A set of FORTRAN programs to implement a multiple-trait Gibbs sampling algorithm for (co)variance component inference in animal models (MTGSAM) was developed. The MTGSAM programs are available to the public. The programs support models with correlated genetic effects and arbitrary numbers of covariates, fixed effects, and independent random effects for each trait. Any combination of missing traits is allowed. The programs were used to estimate variance components for 50 replicates of simulated data. Each replicate consisted of 50 animals of each sex in each of four generations, for 400 animals in each replicate for two traits. For MTGSAM, informative prior distributions for variance components were inverted Wishart random variables with 10 df and means equal to the simulation parameters. A total of 15,000 Gibbs sampling rounds were completed for each replicate, with 2,000 rounds discarded for burn-in. For multiple-trait derivative free restricted maximum likelihood (MTDFREML), starting values for the variance components were the simulation parameters. Averages of posterior mean of variance components estimated using MTGSAM with informative and flat prior distributions for variance components and REML estimates obtained using MTDFREML indicated that all three methods were empirically unbiased. Correlations between estimates from MTGSAM using flat priors and MTDFREML all exceeded .99.</p>

Management Zone Analyst Version 1.0 Software,"<p>Management Zone Analyst (MZA) is a decision-aid for creating within-field management zones based on quantitative field information. It mathematically breaks up a field into natural clusters or zones based on the classification parameters and number of zones you specify.</p>
<p>Fertilizing crops more than they need increases the risk of nutrient contamination of water resources. Because many crop production fields are spatially variable in both soil nutrients and crop nutrient need, conventional uniform fertilizer rates often exceed requirements for some field areas. To better match applications to needs and improve nutrient use efficiency, cost-effective and efficient methods are needed to delineate sub-field management zones within which crop fertilizer needs are more uniform. In field-scale studies, we found that densely-spaced measurements of apparent soil electrical conductivity and GPSdetermined elevation were the most useful data for creating management zones related to potential crop productivity and nutrient need for claypan and claypan-like soils in the U.S. Midwest. Zones created from these sources were much more strongly related to yield map data than were traditional soil surveys. In response to requests from farmers and consultants, we developed a decision aid, Management Zone Analyst (MZA), to help them quickly process map information into management zones for variable-rate nutrient applications. The MZA software uses quantitative, georeferenced field information to mathematically divide a field into natural clusters or zones and also helps determine the optimum number of management zones for each field. Our approaches and software are widely used by researchers, commodity organization representatives, and agricultural consultants from at least 39 states and 35 foreign countries.</p>

Manure Cycling Interview Data,"<p>Exploring the potential for nutrient circularity in the beef production system requires an understanding of current practices. Manure nutrients produced in feedlots are an ample source of fertilizer for phosphorus deficient crop and hay lands. However, it is unclear how far manure nutrients are travelling from feedlots, what crops they’re being applied to, and whether those grains are in turn integrated into the feedlot operations. The purpose of these interviews was to ascertain the above information from feedlot managers. In addition, we sought contextual information (provenance of cattle, cattle weights/ages, manure treatment, regulations/guidelines, processing facility destination, barriers, suggestions for improvements). To answer our question about potential manure nutrient circularity, we focused and report here the elements pertaining to feed/grain provenance, crops manure was applied to, and export distance for manure.</p>

Manuresheds: Redesigning crop-livestock agriculture for sustainable intensification,"<p>Nutrient recycling is fundamental to sustainable agricultural systems, but few mechanisms exist to ensure that surplus manure nutrients from animal feeding operations are transported for use on nutrient-deficient croplands. As a result, manure nutrients concentrate in locations where they can threaten environmental health and devalue manure as a fertilizer resource. This data set is from a study advances the concept of the “manureshed” – the lands surrounding animal feeding operations onto which manure nutrients can be redistributed to meet environmental, production, and economic goals. Manuresheds can be managed at multiple scales, for example, on farms with both animals and crops, among animal farms and crop farms within a county, or even among animal farms and crop farms in distant counties. With a focus on redistribution among counties, we classified the 3109 counties of the contiguous United States by their capacity to either supply manure phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) from confined livestock production (“sources”) or to assimilate and remove excess P and N via crops (“sinks”) [see data for N tonnes, P tonnes, N kg/ha, P kg/ha]. Manure nutrient source counties were identified in 40 of the 48 states, with a substantial concentration in the southern US. Source counties for manure P greatly outnumbered source counties for manure N (390 vs. 100), and 99 of the 100 manure N source counties were also source counties for manure P. Conversely, sink counties for manure N outnumbered sink counties for manure P (2766 vs. 2317). We used the P balances of the source and sink counties to delineate four manuresheds dominated by various combinations of confined hog, poultry, dairy, and beef industries [see data for Manuresheds (tonnes)]. The four manuresheds differed in the transport distances needed to assimilate excess manure P from their respective source areas (from 147 ± 51 km for a beef dominated manureshed to 368 ± 140 km for a poultry dominated manureshed), highlighting the need for systems-level strategies to promote manure nutrient recycling that operate across local, county, regional, and national scales.</p>

Measured Annual Nutrient loads from AGricultural Environments (MANAGE) database,"<p>The MANAGE (Measured Annual Nutrient loads from AGricultural Environments) database was developed to be a readily-accessible, easily-queried database of site characteristic and field-scale nutrient export data (Harmel et al., 2006).  Initial funding for MANAGE was provided by USDA-ARS to support the USDA Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP) and the Texas State Soil and Water Conservation Board as part of their mission to understand and mitigate agricultural impacts on water quality.</p>
<p>The original version of MANAGE, which drew heavily from an early 1980’s compilation of nutrient export data (Reckhow et al., 1980; Beaulac, 1980; Beaulac and Reckhow, 1982), created an electronic database with nutrient load data and corresponding site characteristics from 40 studies on agricultural (cultivated and pasture/range) land uses. The first revision in 2008 added N and P load data from 15 additional studies along with N and P runoff concentration data for all 55 studies (Harmel et al., 2008). The second revision in 2016 added 30 runoff studies from forested land uses, 91 drainage water quality studies from drained land, and 12 additional runoff studies from cultivated and pasture/range (Christianson and Harmel, 2015; Harmel et al., 2016). In this expansion, fertilizer application timing, crop yield, and N and P uptake data were added to facilitate analysis of 4R Nutrient Stewardship. The latest revision (Harmel et al., 2022) added 27 studies and Level II ecoregion delineations for each of the 94 studies such that data are now available from 11 of the 50 North American Level II ecoregions, representing the major U.S. agricultural regions.</p>
<p>With these updates, MANAGE contains data from a vast majority of published peer-reviewed N and P export studies on homogeneous cultivated, pasture/range, and forested land uses in the US under natural rainfall-runoff conditions, as well as artificially drained agricultural land.  Thus MANAGE facilitates expanded spatial analyses and improved understanding of regional differences, management practice effectiveness, and impacts of land use conversions and management techniques, and it provides valuable data for modeling and decision-making related to agricultural runoff.</p>

Climate-Driven Prediction of Land Water Storage Anomalies: An Outlook for Water Resources Monitoring Across the Conterminous United States. Journal of Hydrology, p.125053”.</p>
<p>The study focused on the conterminous United States (CONUS) which extends over a region of contrasting climates with an uneven distribution of freshwater resources. Under climate change, an exacerbation of the contrast between dry and wet regions is expected across the CONUS and could drastically affect local ecosystems, agriculture practices, and communities. Hence, efforts to better understand long-term spatial and temporal patterns of freshwater resources are needed to plan and anticipate responses. Since 2002, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) satellite observations provide estimates of large-scale land water storage changes with an unprecedented accuracy. However, the limited lifetime and observation gaps of the GRACE mission have sparked research interest for GRACE-like data reconstruction. The study developed a predictive modeling approach to quantify monthly land liquid water equivalence thickness anomaly (LWE) using climate variables including total precipitation (PRE), number of wet day (WET), air temperature (TMP), and potential evapotranspiration (PET). The approach builds on the achievements of the GRACE mission by determining LWE footprints using a multivariate regression on principal components model with lag signals.

<p>Orchardgrass (<em>Dactylis glomerata</em> L.) could serve as a cool-season perennial in southeastern production systems, but often does not behave as a true perennial under high temperature stress conditions of the region. This work sought to develop heat-tolerant orchardgrass germplasm through recurrent phenotypic selection (RPS) that would both reduce secondary seed dormancy caused by high soil temperatures and improve stand persistence over summer months. Selection was conducted in a growth chamber 40/30 °C (12/12 h, light/darkness), with germinated seedlings subjected to an additional 2–3 weeks of 40/30 °C conditions. The base germplasm (Cycle 0) and selected individuals (Cycles 1–3) were transplanted into the field, then harvested for seed. Forty-degree germination tests compared mean cumulative germination, velocity of germination within 8 days (VOG8), and realized heritability. Stand persistence was assessed 1 year after transplanting.</p>

Eight, 0.10‐ha paddocks were established in 2014 as a randomized complete block with four replications, and seeded with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), white clover (Trifolium repens L.), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), narrowleaf plantain (Plantago lanceolata L.), and tall fescue [Schedonorus arundinaceus (Schreb.) Dumort]. Mob‐grazed (MOB) paddocks were grazed by yearling beef cattle twice each year, (70–90–day interval), and rotationally grazed (ROT) paddocks were grazed four to six times each year (when sward height reached 25 cm).</p>

Microbial community structure is affected by cropping sequences and poultry litter under long-term no-tillage,"<p>Soil microorganisms play essential roles in soil organic matter dynamics and nutrient cycling in agroecosystems and have been used as soil quality indicators. The response of soil microbial communities to land management is complex and the long-term impacts of cropping systems on soil microbes is largely unknown. Therefore, changes in soil bacterial community composition were assessed in response to cropping sequences and bio-covers at long-term no-tillage sites. Main effects of four different cropping sequences of corn (Zea mays L.), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), and soybean (Glycine max L.) were rotated in four year phases for 12-yrs at two Tennessee Research and Education Centers in a randomized complete block design with split-block treatments of four winter bio-covers: hairy vetch (Vicia villosa L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), poultry litter, and a fallow control. Using Illumina high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes, bacterial community composition was determined. Composition, diversity, and relative abundance of specific taxa were correlated per cropping system, bio-cover, and their interaction. We found that i) richness and diversity varied temporally and spatially, coinciding with soil carbon, pH, nutrient levels, and climatic variability; ii) community composition varied by cropping system, with continuous corn, soybean, and the corn-soybean rotation presenting a hybrid of the continuous corn and soybean communities; however, continuous cotton resulted in the most varied assemblage; iii) bio-covers asserted the greatest influence on microbial communities; specifically poultry litter treatments differed from cover crops (all of which received inorganic-N). Consequently, microbial diversity was greatest under nutrient rich bio-covers (poultry litter) and high residue producing, less pesticide-intensive cropping sequences (soybean and corn compared to cotton), suggesting a more dynamic soil ecology under these no-till cropping systems. This suggests that nutrient management (inorganic fertilizers vs. animal manure) and greater crop rotations (within 4-yr phases) may directly drive phylogenetic community structure and subsequent ecosystem services across agricultural landscapes.</p>

"Modeling long-term, stage-structured dynamics of Tribolium castaneum at food facilities with and without two types of long-lasting insecticide netting","<p>Insecticide Netting<br />
In this study, we focused on two types of long-lasting insecticide netting (LLIN) that have been found to be effective for managing various stored product insect pests. One is an LLIN consisting of a polyethylene netting (2 × 2 mm mesh, D-Terrence, Vestergaard, Inc., Lausanne, Switzerland) with 0.4% deltamethrin active ingredient (a.i.), while the second one is Carifend® net (40 deniers with mesh size 97 knots/cm2; BASF AG, Ludwigshafen, Germany) containing 0.34% α-cypermethrin (a.i.).</p>
<p>Foundational Model<br />
We used a standard Lefkovitch matrix model to project population growth for <em>Tribolium castaneum</em>, with four life stages (e.g., egg, larva, pupa, and adult;(Lefkovitch,1965). In equation (1), the Leftkovitch matrix L matrix (4 × 4) represents the life-stage structure of <em>T. castaneum</em> which has an egg, larvae, pupae, and an adult, where only the adults contribute to the fecundity, F. By multiplying L with the population vector ni(t), where t is time step (e.g., generation) and i is a life stage, we obtain the resultant vector ni(t + 1), which reveals the distribution of individuals across different life stages in the subsequent time period.<br />
In equation (1), P1 represents the probability of staying in the egg stage and G1 is the probability of moving from the egg to the larval stage, P2 is the probability of staying in the larval stage, G2 is probability of moving from the larval stage to pupal stage, P3 is the probability of staying in the pupal stage, G3 is probability of moving from the pupal stage to adult, while P4 is the probability of staying in the adult stage (Figure 1).</p>
<p>Model Parameterization and Scenarios<br />
We simulated population outcomes for up to 15 generations by using the life table data for <em>T. castaneum</em> using the R package popbio. Survivorship, fecundity, and transition information for each stage were derived from the literature (summarized in Table 1). The developmental duration of eggs, larvae, and pupae were 3.82 ± 0.005, 22.81 ± 0.67, and 6.24 ± 0.071 days (Kollros,1944). The average life duration of the adult used in this study was 221.16 days (Park et al., 1961). We used 94 offspring for fertility from the study Park et al.,(1965) and 99% rate of eclosion from pupae to adult.<br />
In order to explore the sensitivity of the base model to changes in mortality and fecundity, both of these parameters were systematically varied from near zero to their maximum value given in the base model (e.g., F = 94, P4 = 0.871). The parameters were varied alone or in combination and the resulting population growth was plotted. All plots were created using ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) in R software (R Core Team, 2022).<br />
Three empirical scenarios from the literature were modeled containing estimates of fecundity reduction only, survivorship reduction only, or both fecundity and survivorship reduction when using LLIN (R.V. Wilkins et al., 2021; Gerken et al., 2021;Scheff et al., 2021, Scheff et al., 2023; Table 2). An individual projection matrix was constructed for each of the three scenarios and combinations of the reductions in fecundity, survivorship, or both. Population growth and proportion in each life stage was projected for 15 generations for each case, including the base model. Overall variation and oscillation were calculated to compare trends among proportion of life stages in each case. In order to compare differences in population sizes between cases for all generations and for generation 15 only, population sizes for each generation were bootstrapped 1000 times to provide iterative replication. The bootstrapped data were then compared one case to another using proc ttest in SAS (Version 9.4) for all generations and for generation 15 only.  In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine which stage should be targeted to most greatly affect the population growth after exposure to the netting. Moreover, a mortality function based on empirical data with LLIN exposure collected in the laboratory on <em>T. castaneum</em> was implemented.</p>

N3DADE,"<p>This research report documents the Fortran program N3DADE (Nonequilibrium 3-Dimensional Advection-Dispersion Equation) which may be used to evaluate analytical solutions described by Leij et al. [1993]. The analytical solutions pertain to selected cases of three-dimensional solute transport during steady unidirectional water flow in porous media of semi-infinite length in the longitudinal direction, and of infinite length in the transverse directions. The solutions may also be applied to one- and two-dimensional problems. Transport and flow properties of the medium are assumed to be macroscopically uniform. Nonequilibrium solute transfer can occur between two domains in either the liquid or the adsorbed phase. The transport equation contains terms for solute movement by advection and dispersion, and for solute retardation, first-order decay, and zero-order production. Solute concentrations are calculated as a function of time and space in a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system.</p>
<p>This report serves as both a user manual for the program and as documentation of the general analytical solutions of the boundary, initial and production value problems involved. A comprehensive set of specific solutions is presented using Dirac, Heaviside and exponential functions to describe the initial, boundary and production profiles. A rectangular or circular inflow area is specified for the boundary value problem, while for the initial and production value problems the respective initial and production profiles are defined for parallelepipedal, cylindrical, or spherical regions of the soil. Solutions are given for volume-averaged or resident concentrations, as well as for flux-averaged or flowing concentrations.</p>

NAL Agricultural Thesaurus and Glossary,"<p>The NAL Agricultural Thesaurus (NALT) was first released by the National Agricultural Library in 2002, with in-depth coverage of agriculture, biology, and related disciplines. It contains over 135,000 terms, including 63,000 cross references, and is arranged into <a href=""https://agclass.nal.usda.gov/dne/search_sc.shtml"">17 subject categories</a> which are used to browse the Thesaurus in a specific discipline or subject area. NALT is updated annually each January.  The subject scope of agriculture is broadly defined in the thesaurus, and includes terminology in the supporting biological, physical, and social sciences. Biological nomenclature comprises a majority of the terms in the thesaurus and is located in the ""Taxonomic Classification of Organisms"" Subject Category. Political geography is mainly described at the country level. Published since 2007, the Glossary is a collection of definitions of agricultural terms developed in conjunction with the creation of the NAL Agricultural Thesaurus. The 2018 edition of the glossary contains 5,618 terms ranging across agriculture and its many ancillary subjects. Most definitions were composed by the NAL Thesaurus Staff. Those definitions taken from government sources are indicated in the ""Definition Source"" field and are included in the bibliography. In 2010, the thesaurus was made available as Linked Open Data. Linked Open Data translates information into a form both readable and understandable by computers. This translation makes it possible for different information resources, such as Web pages, datasets and research articles, to be interconnected, creating meaningful relationships that make it easier to locate related content. In May 2007, Spanish language versions of its NAL Agricultural Thesaurus (NALT) and Glossary of Agricultural Terms were published under the Spanish language names ""Tesauro Agrícola"" and ""Glosario"". The Thesaurus and Glossary are produced cooperatively by the USDA National Agricultural Library and the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA), as well as other Latin American agricultural institutions belonging to the Agriculture Information and Documentation Service of the Americas (SIDALC).

<p>Best nutrient management practices are critical for maintaining profitable economic returns, sustaining higher yields, lowering environmental impacts, optimizing nutritional quality, and providing ecosystem services. Best management practices that improve nutrient use efficiencies can reduce nutrient losses from agricultural systems. However, we need to improve our understanding of biological, physical and chemical influences on nutrient processes. For instance, crop use efficiency of nitrogen (N), the primary macronutrient regulating yield and protein content, can be reduced by processes such as denitrification (N2O and N2 emission), leaching (NH4-N, NO3-N, and organic-N), ammonia (NH3-N,) volatilization, surface runoff and erosion, disease, and non-crop competition. Similarly, we need to obtain more information about biological and physical cycles of nutrients, especially phosphorus (P), including factors that influence nutrient availability from fertilizers, crop residues, cover crops, manures, and other byproducts. We need a better understanding of relationships between soil biological communities and ecosystems, including plant roots and root exudates, and availability and uptake of macro- and micro-nutrients.  In addition, we need information regarding how these practices impact yields, organoleptic qualities, and the macro- and micro-nutritional composition of plants.  This information will improve our ability to develop best nutrient management practices.</p>
<p>Optimal soil nutrient levels are critical for maximizing economic returns, increasing sustainable yields, lowering environmental impacts, sustaining ecosystem services and optimizing nutritional and organoleptic qualities of human and animal foods. Efficient management practices are crucial for increasing economic returns for land managers in a sustainable manner while producing high quality of food for animals and humans with reduced off-site transfer of nutrients from agricultural areas in watersheds. Optimizing N and P inputs requires more information about nutrient inputs from fertilizers, manures, composts, agricultural byproducts, cover crops, and other nutrient sources in addition to nutrient cycling within soils.  This requires data from long-term nutrient management studies across a wide range of soils, crops, and environmental conditions. Land management needs are to connect nutrient management practices for crops with nutrient use efficiency; crop quality; crop chemical composition and nutritional value, quality and acceptability for animal and human health.  Development of databases that enable the scientific exploration of connections among data generated from diverse research efforts such as nutrient management, fate and ecosystem service outcomes, nutritional composition of crops, and animal and human health, is needed.</p>
<p>Nitrogen is a key nutrient that enhances agricultural yield and protein content, but multiple N loss pathways, as previously mentioned, reduce crop N use efficiency (NUE). Implementing proper management practices is needed to reduce N losses from agricultural systems. ARS has multidisciplinary scientific teams with expertise in soils, ecological engineering, hydrology, livestock management and nutrition, horticulture, crop breeding, human and animal nutrition, post-harvest management and processing, and other areas, and intentional collaboration among these teams offers opportunities to rapidly improve NUE and crop quality and reduce off-site N losses.</p>
<p>Similarly, increased P use efficiencies are needed to enhance and ensure sustainable agricultural production and to reduce environmental degradation of water sources. Manure is a valuable source of P and it can be used as a soil amendment to reduce crop production costs. However, there is a need to improve our understanding of the biological and physical cycles of soil P, as well as to obtain more information about P supplies from fertilizer, crop residues, cover crops, manure, and byproducts, and livestock nutrition impacts on manure properties.</p>
<p>There is also a need for a better understanding of soil biological communities and ecosystems, including plant roots and root exudates and how their interactions with crops and community ecology affect yield and the uptake of macro- and micro-nutrients and the ultimate nutritional composition and organoleptic qualities of the crop. Studies documenting the responses of crop-associated biological communities to management practices and genetic technologies implemented across multiple environments (e.g., soil types and chemistries, hydrologic regimes, climates) will improve our understanding of gaps in macro- and micro-nutrient management strategies.</p>
<p>A goal of the USDA-ARS is to increase agricultural production and quality while reducing environmental impacts. The Nutrient Uptake and Outcomes (NUOnet) database will be able to help establish baselines on nutrient use efficiencies; processes contributing to nutrient losses; and processes contributing to optimal crop yield, nutritional and organoleptic quality. This national database could be used to calculate many different environmental indicators from a comprehensive understanding of nutrient stocks and flows. Increasing our understanding of stocks and flows could help in the identification of knowledge gaps as well as areas where increased efficiencies can be achieved at a national level. NUOnet could also be used to develop tools to derive cost-benefit curves associated with nutrient management improvement scenarios and assess local, regional and national impacts of off-site nutrient loss. Understanding how agricultural production impacts human health is a challenge, and the database could be used to link crop management strategies to crop chemical composition to human consumption patterns and ultimately to human health outcomes. A national database will also be very important for development and evaluation of new technologies such as real-time sensing or other proximal and remote sensing technologies that enable assessment of nutrient use efficiencies, particularly at the grower level. The database could also be used to develop analyses that will contribute to the recommendation of policies for resource allocations that will most effectively fulfill the goals of the Grand Challenge. Such a national database with contributions from peers across different national programs could also enhance collaborations between ARS, universities, and extension specialists, as well as with producers, industry, and other partners.</p>

"NVND Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Sidney, Montana","<p>NVND Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Sidney, Montana<br />
Management practices, such as irrigation, tillage, cropping system, and N fertilization, may influence soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We quantified the effects of irrigation, tillage, crop rotation, and N fertilization on soil CO2, N2O, and CH4 emissions from March to November, 2008 to 2011 in a Lihen sandy loam in western North Dakota. Treatments were two irrigation practices (irrigated and non-irrigated) and five cropping systems (conventional-tilled malt barley [Hordeum vulgaris L.] with N fertilizer [CTBFN], conventional-tilled malt barley with no N fertilizer [CTBON], no-tilled malt barley-pea [Pisum sativum L.] with N fertilizer [NTB-PN], no-tilled malt barley with N fertilizer [NTBFN], and no-tilled malt barley with no N fertilizer [NTBON]). The GHG fluxes varied with date of sampling while peaking immediately after precipitation, irrigation, and/or N fertilization events during increased soil temperature. Both CO2 and N2O fluxes were greater in CTBFN under the irrigated condition but CH4 uptake was greater in NTB-PN under the non-irrigated condition than in other treatments. While tillage and N fertilization increased CO2 and N2O fluxes by 8 to 30%, N fertilization and monocropping reduced CH4 uptake by 39 to 40%. The NTB-PN, regardless of irrigation, might mitigate GHG emissions by reducing CO2 and N2O emissions and increasing CH4 uptake relative to other treatments. To account for global warming potential for such a practice, information on productions associated with CO2 emissions along with N2O and CH4 fluxes are needed.</p>

We report N2O emissions along with CO2 and CH4 from a silage corn (2013)–barley (2014)–alfalfa (2015) rotation under conventional tillage and sprinkler irrigation. The main study objectives were to evaluate the effectiveness of an enhanced-efficiency fertilizer (SuperU; stabilized granular urea with urease and nitrification inhibitors) to reduce N2O emissions when compared to granular urea, and determine GHG emissions from fall-applied dairy manure or composted dairy manure and spring-applied dairy manure. Nitrogen treatments were only applied during the first two years of the study. Compared to urea, SuperU plots emitted 53% less N2O during the monitoring period with corn, while no N2O emission reductions occurred in 2014 with barley. The N2O-N emission losses as a percentage of total N applied were 0.21% and 0.04% for urea and SuperU in 2013, respectively, with losses of 0.05% from both urea fertilizers in 2014. On average, N2O fluxes from fall and spring manure were statistically similar and greater than the other N treatments in 2014, and there was a lasting manure treatment effect on emissions when under alfalfa. Carbon dioxide fluxes, on average, were greatest from fall- and spring-applied manure during the first two years of study. Methane fluxes were negative on average, indicating microbial oxidation, and no differences occurred among the N treatments. Silage corn, barley grain, and alfalfa yields were statistically similar among all N treatments. This work demonstrates that SuperU can potentially reduce N2O emissions from irrigated cropping systems in the semiarid western United States while not affecting crop yields.</p>

National Plant Germplasm System,"<p>Global food availability and security is based on intensive agricultural production. Over the past century, this intensification has relied heavily on producing crops with increasing genetic uniformity. Although these practices have benefits, they also include the risks of increasing the vulnerability of crops to pests, diseases, and environmental stress.</p>
<p>Plant breeding and associated scientific research is essential to meet the ongoing challenges of producing plants for food, fiber, animal feeds, industrial and medicinal purposes, and for landscape and ornamental uses. It is important to collect and conserve living plant material, both to help solve immediate agricultural production problems as well as safeguard plant genetic diversity for future needs. This mission is more essential than ever because the loss of genetic diversity is accelerating with threats from many factors including global urbanization, habitat changes associated with climate, and changes in land use related to population growth and economic development.</p>
<p>The U.S. National Plant Germplasm System (NPGS) is collaborative effort to safeguard the genetic diversity of agriculturally important plants. The NPGS is managed by the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the in-house research agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Funding for the NPGS comes primarily through appropriations from the U.S. Congress. However, the NPGS is a partnership between the public and private sectors. Many NPGS genebanks are located at state land-grant university sites, which contribute lab, office, greenhouse and field space for operations, as well as staff for technical and support services. The private sector is a major user of the NPGS collections and is the primary means by which new and improved plants are commercialized.</p>

"Nebraska Prairie Study for Agricultural Antibiotic Resistance in Lincoln, Nebraska","<p>Nebraska Prairie Study for Agricultural Antibiotic Resistance in Lincoln, Nebraska<br />
The inherent spatial heterogeneity and complexity of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance (AR) genes in manureaffected soils makes it difficult to sort out resistance that can be attributed to human antibiotic use from resistance that occurs naturally in the soil. This study characterizes native Nebraska prairie soils that have not been affected by human or food-animal waste products to provide data on background levels of resistance in southeastern Nebraskan soils. Soil samples were collected from 20 sites enumerated on tetracycline and cefotaxime media; screened for tetracycline-, sulfonamide-, b-lactamase–, and macrolide-resistance genes; and characterized for soil physical and chemical parameters. All prairies contained tetracyclineand cefotaxime-resistant bacteria, and 48% of isolates collected were resistant to two or more antibiotics. Most (98%) of the soil samples and all 20 prairies had at least one tetracycline gene. Most frequently detected were tet(D), tet(A) tet(O), tet(L), and tet(B). Sulfonamide genes, which are  considered a marker of human or animal activity, were detected in 91% of the samples, despite the lack of human inputs at these sites. No correlations were found between either phenotypic or genotypic resistance and soil physical or chemical parameters. Heterogeneity was observed in AR within and between prairies. Therefore, multiple samples are necessary to overcome heterogeneity and to accurately assess AR. Conclusions regarding AR depend on the gene target measured. To determine the impacts of food-animal antibiotic use on resistance, it is essential that background and/or baseline levels be considered, and where appropriate subtracted out, when evaluating AR in agroecosystems.</p>

Use of dietary amendments to reduce nitrogen (N) in excreta represents a possible strategy to decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from livestock.  In this regard, ingestion of small amounts of condensed quebracho tannin has been found to reduce N concentration in livestock urine.  In this study, we sought to quantify the effects of tannin-affected cattle urine, normal cattle urine, and NH4NO3 in solution on greenhouse gas flux.  Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) flux was measured using static chamber methodology from the three N treatments and a no application control over a six-week period in a mixed grass prairie in west-central North Dakota, USA.  Over the course of the study, average CO2 emission was greatest from normal urine (335 ± 8 mg C m-2 hr-1) and least from the control (229 ± 19 mg C m-2 hr-1), with intermediate fluxes for the tannin urine and NH4NO3 treatments (290 ± 27 and 286 ± 54 mg C m-2 hr-1, respectively).  Methane uptake was prevalent throughout the study, as soil conditions were predominantly warm and dry.  Uptake of CH4 was greatest within the control (-30 ± 2 µg C m-2 hr-1) and least in the tannin urine treatment (-12 ± 4 µg C m-2 hr-1).  Uptake of CH4 was over 40% less within the tannin urine treatment as compared to normal urine, and may have been repressed by the capacity of tannin to bind monooxygenases responsible for CH4 oxidation.  Average N2O emission from NH4NO3 solution was more than twice that of all other treatments.  Though the tannin urine treatment possessed 34% less N than normal cattle urine, cumulative N2O emission between the treatments did not differ.  Results from this study suggest the use of condensed quebracho tannin as a dietary amendment for livestock does not yield GHG mitigation benefits in the short-term.</p>

All variables are monthly averages or sums over the fiscal year (FY), October 01 (of the prior calendar year, y-1) through September 30 of the current calendar year (y). Annual records on detections of <em>Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus</em> and <em>R.

Details of tick survey procedures, CFTEP program goals and history, and the geographic extent of the Permanent Quarantine Zone are in SI (Introduction, details). Solar radio flux data as well as Pacific Ocean El Niño Oscillation index data, 1950-2017, are accessed at from NOAA ESRL (2018b). Predicted values for on-going Solar Cycle 24 are from NOAA SWPC (2018). Accumulated Cyclone Energy Index (ACE) data are from the NOAA ESRL (2018a) database. Hurricane incidence data over the PQZ are accessed at the NOAA (2018) tropical storm database.</p>
<p>Local meteorology data are from the NOAA NCDC (2018) climate portal for three weather stations (Del Rio International Airport TX, Laredo Municipal Airport TX, and Brownsville South Padre Island International Airport TX). Details on these stations and data are in the SI (Methods and Data, additional details).</p>
<p>Data Pre-treatment: Global climate indicators, local meteorology, and CFT variables are assembled into a single MS Excel matrix. To address the low signal-to-noise ratio and non-independence of time series common in weather data (SI Methods and Data, additional details, tests). We transform all predictor and response variables using a series of five consecutive steps: 1) first differences (year n minus year n-1) were calculated; 2) and these converted to z scores (z = (x- μ) / σ); 3) linear regression was used to remove directional trends; 4) moving averages were calculated for each data vector, and; 5) a lag was optionally applied. The transformed data variables were then tested for predictive ability using simple correlation, probability of, error and level of significance.</p>
<p>Bivariate and Multivariate Regression Analysis: Four bivariate Best Model regressions of climate predictors on CFT are developed using XLSTAT software (Addinsoft Inc. 2018); three multivariate models include regression with no interactions, with level 2 interactions, and with variables restricted to two and to four variables minimum. To validate each model, we withhold the first and last 29 observations points. Nine model evaluation and three summary statistics are identified in SI (Methods and Data, additional details, definitions).</p>
<p>Reconstruction of Complete CFT Cycle, and Projection: It is generally recognized that the onset year of the first outbreak is not 1959 but some earlier point in the decade. Likewise, 2017 is unlikely the final end-year of the current outbreak. Given the lack of complete data on any one CFT outbreak cycle, we average CFT levels over Outbreak 1 and Outbreak 2, using 1987 as the mid-point between outbreaks (see Fig. 2). Using a Hurricane-Hale Cycle construct (SI Fig. 1), we hypothesize Outbreak 1 starts in 1943 and ends in 1987; Outbreak 2 starts in 1987 and ends in 2030-2031. We then extend the full CFT pattern one cycle into the future to forecast likely incidence beyond 2030.</p>

Interest in harvesting crop residues for energy has waxed and waned since the oil embargo of 1973.  Since the at least the late 1990’s interest has been renewed due to concern of peak oil, highly volatile natural gas prices, replacing fossil fuel with renewable sources and a push for energy independence.  The studies conducted on harvesting crop residues during the 1970’s and1980’s focused primarily on erosion risk and nutrient removal as a result early estimates of residue availability focused on erosion control (Perlack et al., 2005).  More recently, the focus has expanded to also address harvest impacts on soil organic matter and other constraints (Wilhelm et al., 2007; Wilhelm et al., 2010).  In West Central Minnesota, crop residues have been proposed a replacement for natural gas (Archer and Johnson, 2012) while nationally residues are also be considered for cellulosic ethanol production (US DOE, 2011).  The objective of the on-farm study was to assess the impact of residue harvest on working farms with different management systems and soils.  Indicators of erosion risk, soil organic matter, and crop productivity is response to grain plus cob, or grain plus stover compared to grain only harvest.</p>

Oncopeltus fasciatus genome annotations v0.5.3,"<p>The <em>Oncopeltus fasciatus</em> genome was recently sequenced and annotated as part of the i5k pilot project by the Baylor College of Medicine.<br />
The <em>O. fasciatus</em> research community has manually reviewed and curated the computational gene predictions and generated an official gene set, OGSv1.1.</p>
<p><em>Oncopeltus fasciatus</em> has been an established lab organism for over 60 years, and has been used for a wide range of studies from physiology to development and evolution. As a relatively conservative and generalized species, it affords a baseline against which other species can be compared.</p>
<p>For example, this species has the same piercing and sucking type mouthparts as its less benign relatives, including the blood-sucking kissing bug, <em>Rhodnius prolixus</em>, and the brown marmorated stink bug, <em>Halyomorpha halys</em>, which are disease vector and agricultural pest species, respectively. Unlike the pest species, the benign, seed-feeding <em>Oncopeltus</em> can be functionally investigated in the lab by RNA interference (RNAi). Comparing the genomes, and conducting experimental lab work in <em>Oncopeltus</em>, will help to identify unique features of the pest species, and thus inform management strategies for them.</p>
<p>More generally, <em>Oncopeltus</em> is a key species for comparisons across the insects. It is one of the few experimentally tractable hemimetabolous species that can ground comparisons with the completely metamorphosing species of the Holometabola (e.g., flies, beetles, wasps). Topics investigated in this framework include reproductive biology and development of the legs, wings, body segments, extraembryonic membranes, and overall establishment of the body plan.</p>
<p>This dataset presents the <em>Oncopeltus fasciatus</em> gene set BCM_v_0.5.3, which was generated computationally. RNA-Seq data was used with additional protein homology data for a MAKER automated annotation of the Oncopeltus fasciatus genome assembly 1.0. Further annotation method details will be available in a forthcoming publication.</p>
<p>NOTE: This gene set is an unstable pre-release (v0.5.3), and was provided to facilitate manual curation and analyses before the official gene set is released. Gene identifiers from this gene set will likely not be maintained.</p>

Dairy manure is commonly used in place of inorganic N fertilizers but the impacts on trace gas flux, yields and soil N are not well understood in the semiarid western US. CO2, N2O, and CH4 were monitored using surface chamnbers from 5 N treatments to determine their effect on greenhouse gas emissions from a tilled clay loam soil under irrigated, continuous corn production for a 3 yr. time period.  Treatments included (i) partially composed dairy manure (DM) (412 kg N ha -1), (ii) DM + AgrotainPlus (DM + AP), (iii) enhanced efficiency N fertilizer (SuperU, or SUPRU) (179 kg N ha-1), (iv) Urea (179 kg N ha-1), and (v) check.  These results highlight the importance of best-managemnet practices such as immediate irrigation after N application and use of urease and nitrification inhibitors to minimize N losses.</p>

PIVNOZ-PIPELOSS,"<p>These two software programs have been developed to aid in the design and analysis of center pivot and traveling lateral sprinkler irrigation systems.</p>
<p>PIVNOZ</p>
<p>To install the program, run SETUP.exe from the Pivnoz directory. This Windows program calculates nozzle sizes and estimates application rates for center pivot sprinkler systems and linearly traveling laterals, for commonly used sprinkler packages. It can be used to nozzle a complete pivot lateral or a section of a pivot lateral. The user must know the desired system capacity, the desired sprinkler spacing(s) along the lateral, and the nozzle pressure(s). Each of the input values can be entered in selected English or metric units as desired.</p>
<p>Initial inputs:<br />
Select either pivot or linear. A linear will be nozzled uniformly.<br />
Enter the system capacity. This is the gross flow per unit area irrigated or the gross depth applied per day on an average daily basis. Any application efficiency estimate must be built in to this value. Select desired units (i.e., mm/day or gpm/acre).<br />
Enter the nozzle pressure. If you desire to use different pressures on different sections, run each section separately.</p>
<p>Pivot inputs:<br />
Enter the beginning and end distances from the pivot of the section for which the nozzling is to be calculated.<br />
Select fixed or variable nozzle spacing.<br />
For fixed spacing, enter the desired nozzle spacing. For variable spacing enter the desired nozzle flow rate.</p>
<p>Linear inputs:<br />
Enter the desired nozzle spacing.<br />
Enter the length of the lateral.<br />
Enter the total travel distance of the lateral.<br />
Enter the percent downtime required for moving the supply hose, etc.</p>
<p>Sprinkler package:</p>
<p>The user may skip this section if only nozzle sizes are desired. Select a specific package by clicking on the drop down box on the right. A list of several available rotating or oscillating-plate packages will be presented. Consult Nelson or Senninger literature for more information on the specific models and plate types. Enter the total nozzle offset produced by the addition of fore and aft spray booms. Enter the mounting height above ground or above the average crop height. If a different type of sprinkler is desired, select the generic box and enter the approximate pattern width for that sprinkler.</p>
<p>Outputs:<br />
Select English or Metric output.<br />
Click RUN to view the output on the right side of the screen.<br />
If any of the inputs are changed, you must click RUN again to recalculate the output.<br />
Nozzle sizes are given in English or metric units and equivalent numbered sizes (1/128 and 1/64 inch increments) used with most commercially available nozzle packages. The pattern width is the diameter of the spray pattern plus the nozzle offset entered above. The peak application rate is the approximate peak of the application rate pattern and not an instantaneous rate which can be much higher.<br />
The output can be saved to a file or printed if desired.</p>
<p>PIPELOSS<br />
To install the program, run SETUP.exe from the Pipeloss directory.<br />
This Windows program calculates friction losses in individual pipe sections or laterals with multiple, uniformly spaced outlets, either uniform discharge laterals, or center pivot laterals. The program can also handle a lateral comprised of two pipe sections with different diameters and lengths. The program also supplies data on exact inside diameters and friction coefficients for most types of pipe used in irrigation. This software works with either English or Metric units. Pipeloss is installed as a popup Windows program. Additional help in running the program is available by pressing the ""readme"" button on the screen.</p>

"Patterns of precipitation and productivity on various topographic positions on the Central Plains Experimental Range, Nunn, Colorado","<p>Thirty-six years of aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) data collected across a topographic sequence in the semiarid shortgrass steppe of North America to examine patterns and drivers of spatiotemporal variability in ANPP. ANPP data were collected from the 6,500 ha USDA-Central Plains Experimental Range (CPER), which is part of the Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR; 2012-present; <a href=""https://ltar.ars.usda.gov/"">https://ltar.ars.usda.gov/</a>) network, a former Long-Term Ecological Research station (LTER, 1983-2012), and located in the shortgrass steppe of north-central Colorado, USA. Additional information and referenced materials about many of the long-term studies initiated on the CPER can be found: <a href=""https://dx.doi.org/10.25675/10217/81141"">https://dx.doi.org/10.25675/10217/81141</a>.</p>
<p>The topography at the CPER is characterized by gently rolling hills, and the topographic positions for data collection were focused along a catena in one of the most common ecological sites on the CPER, Loamy Plains (ID: R067BY002CO; NRCS, 2020). The plant community included four herbaceous plant functional types (PFTs): 1) perennial, warm-season, C4 grasses (primarily Bouteloua gracilis [Willd. ex Kunth] Lag ex Griffiths and B. dactyloides [Nutt.] J.T. Columbus), 2) perennial, cool-season, C3 grasses (primarily Pascopyrum smithii [Rydb] A. Love and Hesperostipa comata [Trin. & Rupr.] Barkworth ssp. comata), 3) cool-season, annual grass (Vulpia octoflora [Walter] Rydb.), and 4) forbs (primarily Sphaeralcea coccinea [Nutt.] Rydb.). Shrubs, subshrubs, and cactus were present but do not represent a large component of total ANPP and were not included in this study.</p>
<p>Daily precipitation data were obtained from a long-term (1979-2018) precipitation gauge associated with the National Atmospheric Deposition program (Site ID: NTN-CO22; <a href=""http://nadp.slh.wisc.edu/"">http://nadp.slh.wisc.edu/</a>), located on site. Missing precipitation data were gap-filled using CPER headquarters data (1939-2018), or from the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) rain gauge (1997-2018, Site Number: 2017; <a href=""https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/"">https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/</a>), depending on proximity and temporal overlap. Following gap-filling, precipitation data were omitted if &gt;10% of the time series was missing for each focal time period (e.g. fall or spring).</p>

"Perennial grass recovery following livestock overgazing and shrub removal: an experiment at the Jornada Experimental Range (Jornada Basin LTER), 1996-2016","<p>The objective of this ongoing study is to determine the effect of cattle grazing and shrub removal on the decline and recovery of perennial grasses in a mesquite-invaded black grama grassland on sandy soils in the northern Chihuahuan Desert. The experiment was implemented as a randomized complete block with 3 levels of grazing (summer, winter, and control) and 2 levels of shrub treatment (shrub removal and control) in each of 3 replicate blocks. The 18 experimental units are 0.5 ha (70 x 70 m) exclosures constructed in a mesquite-invaded black grama grassland in the southwest portion of the Jornada Experimental Range in Dona Ana County, New Mexico, USA. Vegetation sampling was conducted with the line-point intercept method. Initial pre-treatment sampling occurred in 1996. Grazing treatments removed 65-80% of aboveground perennial grass biomass over 24-36 hour periods in each of four years from summer 1996 to winter 2000; shrub removal occurred during this time as well. No livestock grazing or shrub removal have occurred since 2000. Post-treatment sampling occurred in 2002, 2009, and 2016.</p>

The archived images provide a permanent record that can be visually-inspected to determine the phenological state of the vegetation at any point in time. Vegetation greenness metrics (e.g., GCC) derived from the ratio of the green color band to sum of red, green, and blue color bands serve as proxies for vegetation greenness.  Greenness metrics can be extracted from the images using simple image processing methods in 1-day or 3-day increments.<br />

Phytophthora Database,"<p>NOTE: This resource, previously available at <a href=""http://www.phytophthoradb.org"">www.phytophthoradb.org</a>, is no longer publicly accessible.</p>
<p>This database aims to include Phytophthora collections throughout the world in order to create a global atlas of the diversity and distribution of Phytophthora species.</p>
<p>Phytophthora, an oomycete plant pathogen, is more closely related to brown algae and diatoms than true fungi and has been placed in a separate kingdom, the Stramenopiles (Gunderson et al., 1987;   Förster et al., 1990; Leipe et al., 1994). Due to their high virulence and ability to spread rapidly throughout the world, Phytophthora is one of the most important groups of plant pathogens. The destructive potential of Phytophthora diseases is well illustrated by late blight (P. infestans), which was responsible for the Irish potato famine and has again become globally problematic due to the introduction of new, fungicide-resistant lineages (Fry and Goodwin, 1997). Sudden oak death in the US (Rizzo et al., 2002) and diseases on ornamental plants in Europe (Werres et al., 2001), caused by P. ramorum, are examples of the threat to forest ecosystems and the nursery industry.</p>
<p>Toward the goal of enhancing our ability to detect, diagnose, monitor, and manage Phytophthora diseases, we have been systematically cataloging genotypic and phenotypic data of Phytophthora spp. in a web-based database that can be easily accessed and utilized by the global community of plant health professionals. Although we are currently focusing on the genotypic characterization of the isolates archived in the World Phytophthora Collection (WPC; Phytophthora.ucr.edu) at UC-Riverside and in the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (PDA), we plan to include Phytophthora collections throughout the world in order to create a global atlas of the diversity and distribution of Phytophthora species. </p>
<p>This project has been mainly supported by the NRI-Plant Biosecurity program (2005-35605-15393 and 2008-55605-18773) and currently involves the following principal investigators, including Seogchan Kang, David Geiser, and Scott Isard (Penn State), Mike Coffey (UC-Riverside), Joe Russo (ZedX, Inc.), Kelly Ivors (NC State), Frank Martin and Nik Grunwald (USDA-ARS).

"Plant Cover at Permanent Quad Locations on the Jornada Experimental Range, 1915-ongoing","<p>This ongoing data set contains basal cover of perennial grasses and canopy cover of shrubs in 122 1m x 1m quadrats on the Jornada Experimental Range in the northern extent of the Chihuahuan Desert of New Mexico, USA. These quadrats were established to investigate livestock grazing effects on plant community dynamics as well as responses to variable climatic conditions over time. Vegetation monitoring is carried out by charting the basal areas of perennial grasses and canopy areas of shrubs within each quadrat. Quadrats were established at different times, with start dates from 1915 to 1932. Specific quadrat locations were selected for a variety of reasons, but the overall intent was to represent varying plant community conditions across the Jornada Experimental Range. From 1915 to 1924 charting was done by dividing the quadrat frame into a decimeter grid using straps and reproducing locations of plants on grid paper. From 1925 to 2016 charting was done using a pantograph. With few exceptions, quadrats were charted until 1947, and a portion of the quadrats were charted intermittently between 1947 and 1979. Sampling resumed again in 1995 and continues every 5-6 years. Charts are digitally scanned, georeferenced, and chart features are digitally reproduced by hand. This data set is not yet complete; charts are actively being processed by Jornada Experimental Range staff and will be updated to this data package as they become available. A companion data package of counts of perennial forbs and subshrubs for each quadrat is also available for this project (data package knb-lter-jrn.210351002).</p>

Plant Expression Database,"<p>[NOTE: PLEXdb is no longer available online. Oct 2019.]</p>
<p>PLEXdb (Plant Expression Database) is a unified gene expression resource for plants and plant pathogens. PLEXdb is a genotype to phenotype, hypothesis building information warehouse, leveraging highly parallel expression data with seamless portals to related genetic, physical, and pathway data.</p>
<p>PLEXdb (<a href=""http://www.plexdb.org"">http://www.plexdb.org</a>), in partnership with community databases, supports comparisons of gene expression across multiple plant and pathogen species, promoting individuals and/or consortia to upload genome-scale data sets to contrast them to previously archived data. These analyses facilitate the interpretation of structure, function and regulation of genes in economically important plants. A list of Gene Atlas experiments highlights data sets that give responses across different developmental stages, conditions and tissues. Tools at PLEXdb allow users to perform complex analyses quickly and easily. The Model Genome Interrogator (MGI) tool supports mapping gene lists onto corresponding genes from model plant organisms, including rice and Arabidopsis. MGI predicts homologies, displays gene structures and supporting information for annotated genes and full-length cDNAs. The gene list-processing wizard guides users through PLEXdb functions for creating, analyzing, annotating and managing gene lists. Users can upload their own lists or create them from the output of PLEXdb tools, and then apply diverse higher level analyses, such as ANOVA and clustering. PLEXdb also provides methods for users to track how gene expression changes across many different experiments using the Gene OscilloScope. This tool can identify interesting expression patterns, such as up-regulation under diverse conditions or checking any gene’s suitability as a steady-state control.</p>

"Plant phenology observations at 15 sites at Jornada Basin LTER, 1992-ongoing","<p>This ongoing data package, which began in 1992, contains monthly plant phenological observations by species at the 15 Net Primary Production (NPP) study sites at the Jornada Experimental Range (JER) or Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) in Dona Ana County, New Mexico, USA. Sites were selected to represent the 5 major ecosystem types in the Chihuahuan Desert (upland grasslands, playa grasslands, mesquite-dominated shrublands, creosotebush-dominated shrublands, tarbush-dominated shrublands). For each ecosystem type, three sites were selected to represent the range in variability in production and plant diversity; thus the locations are not replicates. A transect at each site is monitored monthly to assess the following phenological stages for each species: dormancy, non-reproductive status, budding, flowering, and fruiting. Sampling methods in the first years of the study monitored all plant species present but have been changed to focus on specific species at each site.</p>

"Poultry Litter Study for Agricultural Antibiotic Resistance in Bowling Green, Kentucky","<p>Poultry litter (PL) is a by-product of broiler production. Most PL is land applied. Land-applied PL is a valuable nutrient source for crop production but can also be a route of environmental contamination with manure-borne bacteria. The objective of this study was to characterize the fate of pathogens, fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), and bacteria containing antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) after application of PL to soils under conventional till or no-till management. This 2-yr study was conducted in accordance with normal agricultural practices, and microbial populations were quantified using a combination of culture and quantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. Initial concentrations of Campylobacter jejuni in PL were 5.4 ± 3.2 × 106 cells g-1 PL; Salmonella sp. was not detected in the PL but was enriched periodically from PL-amended soils. Escherichia coli was detected in PL (1.5 ± 1.3 × 102 culturable or 1.5 ± 0.3 × 107 genes g-1) but was rarely detected in field soils, whereas enterococci (1.5 ± 0.5 × 108 cells g-1 PL) were detected throughout the study. These results suggest that enterococci may be better FIB for field-applied PL. Concentrations of ARGs for sulfonamide, streptomycin, and tetracycline resistance increased up to 3.0 orders of magnitude after PL application and remained above background for up to 148 d. These data provide new knowledge about important microbial FIB, pathogens, and ARGs associated with PL application under realistic field-based conditions.</p>

Prediction of Cattle Fever Tick Outbreaks in United States Quarantine Zone,"<p>[NOTE - 11/24/2021: this dataset supersedes an earlier version <a href=""https://doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1518654"">https://doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1518654</a> ]</p>
<p><strong>Data sources</strong>. Time series data on cattle fever tick incidence, 1959-2020, and climate variables January 1950 through December 2020, form the core information in this analysis. All variables are monthly averages or sums over the fiscal year, October 01 (of the prior calendar year, <em>y</em>-1) through September 30 of the current calendar year (<em>y</em>). Annual records on monthly new detections of <em>Rhipicephalus microplus</em> and <em>R. annulatus</em> (cattle fever tick, CFT) on premises within the Permanent Quarantine Zone (PQZ) were obtained from the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program (CFTEP) maintained jointly by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal Plant Health Inspection Service and the USDA Animal Research Service in Laredo, Texas. Details of tick survey procedures, CFTEP program goals and history, and the geographic extent of the PQZ are in the main text, and in the Supporting Information (SI) of the associated paper. Data sources on oceanic indicators, on local meteorology, and their pretreatment are detailed in SI.</p>
<p><strong>Data pretreatment</strong>. To address the low signal-to-noise ratio and non-independence of observations common in time series, we transformed all explanatory and response variables by using a series of six consecutive steps: (i) First differences (year <em>y</em> minus year <em>y</em>-1) were calculated, (ii) these were then converted to <em>z</em> scores (<em>z</em> = (<em>x</em>- <em>Î¼</em>) / <em>Ïƒ</em>, where <em>x</em> is the raw value, <em>Î¼</em> is the population mean, <em>Ïƒ</em> is the standard deviation of the population), (iii) linear regression was applied to remove any directional trends, (iv) moving averages (typically 11-year point-centered moving averages) were calculated for each variable, (v) a lag was applied if/when deemed necessary, and (vi) statistics calculated (<em>r, n, df, P&lt;, p&lt;</em>).</p>
<p><strong>Principal component analysis (PCA)</strong>. A matrix of <em>z</em>-score first differences of the 13 climate variables, and CFT (1960-2020), was entered into XLSTAT principal components analysis routine; we used Pearson correlation of the 14 x 60 matrix, and Varimax rotation of the first two components.</p>
<p><strong>Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)</strong>. An ARIMA (2,0,0) model was selected among 7 test models in which the <em>p</em>, <em>d</em>, and <em>q</em> terms were varied, and selection made on the basis of lowest RMSE and AIC statistics, and reduction of partial autocorrelation outcomes. A best model linear regression of CFT values on ARIMA-predicted CFT was developed using XLSTAT linear regression software with the objective of examining statistical properties (<em>r, n, df, P&lt;, p&lt;</em>), including the Durbin-Watson index of order-1 autocorrelation, and Cookâ€™s Di distance index. Cross-validation of the model was made by withholding the last 30, and then the first 30 observations in a pair of regressions.</p>
<p><strong>Forecast of the next major CFT outbreak</strong>. It is generally recognized that the onset year of the first major CFT outbreak was not 1959, but may have occurred earlier in the decade. We postulated the actual underlying pattern is fully 44 years from the start to the end of a CFT cycle linked to external climatic drivers. (SI Appendix, Hypothesis on CFT cycles). The hypothetical reconstruction was projected one full CFT cycle into the future. To substantiate the projected trend, we generated a power spectrum analysis based on 1-year values of the 1959-2020 CFT dataset using SYSTAT AutoSignal software. The outcome included a forecast to 2100; this was compared to the hypothetical reconstruction and projection. Any differences were noted, and the start and end dates of the next major CFT outbreak identified.</p>

"Quadrat vegetation cover data from the long-term Small Mammal Exclusion Study (SMES) at Jornada Basin LTER, 1995-2015","<p>This data package contains vegetation cover from plots with various levels of herbivore exclusion on the Jornada Experimental Range (JER) and Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) in Dona Ana County, southern New Mexico, USA. Study sites were established in 1995; one in black grama grassland and the other in creosotebush shrubland to compare the impact of herbivores on ecosystem processes between these vegetation types. Parallel studies were established at the Sevilleta LTER site (New Mexico, USA) and Mapimi Biosphere Reserve (Durango, Mexico). Each study site is 1 km by 0.5 km in area. Four replicate experimental blocks were randomly located at the grassland study site to measure vegetation responses using exclusion treatments including a) all mammalian herbivores, including cattle, lagomorphs, and rodents, b) lagomorphs and cattle only, c) cattle only, and d) control accessible to all herbivores. Because grazing cattle are excluded from the entire creosote site, only three replicate experimental blocks were randomly located there including a) all mammalian herbivores, including lagomorphs, and rodents, b) lagomorphs only, and c) control accessible to all herbivores. Thirty-six sampling points were positioned at 5.8-meter intervals on a systematically located 6 by 6 point grid within each plot. A permanent one-meter by one-meter vegetation measurement quadrat is located at each of the 36 points. At each quadrat, percent cover by individual plant species is measured. Other measurements include height (cm) of each species in the quadrat, and plant condition (living or dead). Data were collected in the spring and fall of every year from 1995 to 2005. After 2005, sampling frequency changed to every 5 years in the fall. This study is ongoing.</p>

"Quadrat-based monitoring of desert grassland vegetation at the Jornada Experimental Range, New Mexico, 1915-2016","<p>The data set covers a 101-year period (1915-2016) of quadrat-based plant sampling at the Jornada Experimental Range in southern New Mexico. At each sampling event, a pantograph was used to record the location and perimeter of living plants within permanent quadrats. Basal area was recorded for perennial grass species, canopy cover area was recorded for shrub species, and all other perennial species were recorded as point data. The data set includes 122 1m by 1m permanent quadrats, although not all quadrats were sampled in each year of the study and there is a gap in monitoring from 1980-1995. These data provide a unique opportunity to investigate changes in the plant community over 100 years of variation in precipitation and other environmental conditions. We provide the following data and data formats: (1) the digitized maps in shapefile format; (2) data table containing coordinates (x,y) of perennial species within quadrats, including cover area for grasses and shrubs; (3) data table of counts of annual plant individuals per quadrat; (4) species list indicating growth form and habit of recorded species; (5) table of dates when each quadrat was sampled; (6) table of the pasture each quadrat was located within (note that pasture boundaries have changed over time). Additional data to help characterize plant-scale factors related to vegetation dynamics at the quadrat locations are: (7) data table of depth to caliche layer; (8) data table of soil particle size analysis and sand fractionation; and (9) data table of local and patch topography.

Corn stover is an important livestock feed and will probably be a major source of renewable bioenergy, especially in the U.S. Corn Belt. Overly aggressive removal of stover, however, could lead to greater soil erosion and hurt producer yields in the long-run. Good residue management practices could help prevent erosion of valuable topsoil by wind and water while still providing a revenue source for producers, either as livestock feed or for use in renewable bioenergy. Plant residues also contribute to soil structure, nutrient cycling, and help sustain the soil microbiota. Good residue management could also help control the loss of greenhouse gases from agricultural soils that could add to already increasing levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases contributing to global climate change. Cumulative GHG emissions varied widely across locations, by management, and from year-to-year. Despite this high variability, maximum stover removal averaged across all sites, years, and management resulted in lower total emissions of CO2 (-12 ± 11%) and N2O (-13 ± 28%) compared to no stover removal. Decreases in total CO2 and N2O emissions in stover removal treatments were attributed to decreased availability of stover-derived C and N inputs into soils, as well as possible microclimatic differences. Soils at all sites were CH4 neutral or small CH4 sinks. Exceptions to these trends occurred for all GHGs, highlighting the importance of site-specific management and environmental conditions on GHG fluxes in agricultural soils..</p>

RETC,"<p>RETC is a computer program which may be used to analyze the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions of unsaturated soils. These hydraulic properties are key parameters in any quantitative description of water flow into and through the unsaturated zone of soils. The program uses the parametric models of Brooks-Corey and van Genuchten to represent the soil water retention curve, and the theoretical pore-size distribution models of Mualem and Burdine to predict the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function from observed soil water retention data. The program comes with a manual which gives a detailed discussion of the different analytical expressions used for quantifying the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions. A brief review is also given of the nonlinear least-squares parameter optimization method used for estimating the unknown coefficients in the hydraulic models. The RETC program may be used to predict the hydraulic conductivity from observed soil water retention data assuming that one observed conductivity value (not necessarily at saturation) is available.</p>
<p>The program also permits one to fit analytical functions simultaneously to observed water retention and hydraulic conductivity data. Several examples are presented to illustrate a variety of program options.</p>

ROSETTA,"<p>Mathematical models have become increasingly popular in both research and management problems involving flow and transport processes in the subsurface. The unsaturated hydraulic functions are key input data in numerical models of vadose zone processes. These functions may be either measured directly or estimated indirectly through prediction from more easily measured data based using quasi-empirical models. Rosetta V1.0 is a Windows 95/98 program to estimate unsaturated hydraulic properties from surrogate soil data such as soil texture data and bulk density. Models of this type are called pedotransfer functions (PTFs) since they translate basic soil data into hydraulic properties. Rosetta can be used to estimate the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Water retention parameters according to van Genuchten (1980)</li>
<li>Saturated hydraulic conductivity</li>
<li>Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity parameters according to van Genuchten (1980) and Mualem (1976)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Detailed description of the hydraulic functions Rosetta offers five PTFs that allow prediction of the hydraulic properties with limited or more extended sets of input data. This hierarchical approach is of a great practical value because it permits optimal use of available input data. The models use the following hierarchical sequence of input data</p>
<ul>
<li>Soil textural class</li>
<li>Sand, silt and clay percentages</li>
<li>Sand, silt and clay percentages and bulk density</li>
<li>Sand, silt and clay percentages, bulk density and a water retention point at 330 cm (33 kPa).</li>
<li>Sand, silt and clay percentages, bulk density and water retention points at 330 and 15000 cm (33 and 1500 kPa)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The first model is based on a lookup table that provides class average hydraulic parameters for each USDA soil textural class. The other four models are based on neural network analyses and provide more accurate predictions when more input variables are used. In addition to the hierarchical approach, we also offer a model that allows prediction of the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity parameters from fitted van Genuchten (1980) retention parameters (Schaap and Leij, 1999). This model is also used in the hierarchical approach such that it automatically uses the predicted retention parameters as input, instead of measured (fitted) retention parameters.</p>
<p>All estimated hydraulic parameters are accompanied by uncertainty estimates that permit an assessment of the reliability of Rosetta's predictions. These uncertainty estimates were generated by combining the neural networks with the bootstrap method (see Schaap and Leij (1998) and Schaap et al. (1999) for more information).</p>

Rainfall simulation experiments in the Southwestern USA using the Walnut Gulch Rainfall Simulator,"<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
Preservation and management of semi-arid ecosystems requires understanding of the processes involved in soil erosion and their interaction with plant community. Rainfall simulations on natural plots provide an effective way of obtaining a large amount of erosion data under controlled conditions in a short period of time. This dataset contains hydrological (rainfall, runoff, flow velocity), erosion (sediment concentration and rate), vegetation (plant cover), and other supplementary information from 272 rainfall simulation experiments conducted on 23 rangeland locations in Arizona and Nevada between 2002 and 2013. The dataset advances our understanding of basic hydrological and biological processes that drive soil erosion on arid rangelands. It can be used to quantify runoff, infiltration, and erosion rates on a variety of ecological sites in the Southwestern USA. Inclusion of wildfire and brush treatment locations combined with long term observations makes it important for studying vegetation recovery, ecological transitions, and effect of management. It is also a valuable resource for erosion model parameterization and validation.</p>
<p><strong>Instrumentation</strong><br />
Rainfall was generated by a portable, computer-controlled, variable intensity simulator (Walnut Gulch Rainfall Simulator). The WGRS can deliver rainfall rates ranging between 13 and 178 mm/h with variability coefficient of 11% across 2 by 6.1 m area. Estimated kinetic energy of simulated rainfall was 204 kJ/ha/mm and drop size ranged from 0.288 to 7.2 mm. Detailed description and design of the simulator is available in Stone and Paige (2003). Prior to each field season the simulator was calibrated over a range of intensities using a set of 56 rain gages. During the experiments windbreaks were setup around the simulator to minimize the effect of wind on rain distribution. On some of the plots, in addition to rainfall only treatment, run-on flow was applied at the top edge of the plot. The purpose of run-on water application was to simulate hydrological processes that occur on longer slopes (&gt;6 m) where upper portion of the slope contributes runoff onto the lower portion.</p>
<p>Runoff rate from the plot was measured using a calibrated V-shaped supercritical flume equipped with depth gage. Overland flow velocity on the plots was measured using electrolyte and fluorescent dye solution. Dye moving from the application point at 3.2 m distance to the outlet was timed with stopwatch. Electrolyte transport in the flow was measured by resistivity sensors imbedded in edge of the outlet flume. Maximum flow velocity was defined as velocity of the leading edge of the solution and was determined from beginning of the electrolyte breakthrough curve and verified by visual observation (dye). Mean flow velocity was calculated using mean travel time obtained from the electrolyte solution breakthrough curve using moment equation.</p>
<p>Soil loss from the plots was determined from runoff samples collected during each run. Sampling interval was variable and aimed to represent rising and falling limbs of the hydrograph, any changes in runoff rate, and steady state conditions. This resulted in approximately 30 to 50 samples per simulation.</p>
<p>Shortly before every simulation plot surface and vegetative cover was measured at 400 point grid using a laser and line-point intercept procedure (Herrick et al., 2005). Vegetative cover was classified as forbs, grass, and shrub. Surface cover was characterized as rock, litter, plant basal area, and bare soil. These 4 metrics were further classified as protected (located under plant canopy) and unprotected (not covered by the canopy). In addition, plant canopy and basal area gaps were measured on the plots over three lengthwise and six crosswise transects.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental procedure</strong><br />
Four to eight 6.1 m by 2 m replicated rainfall simulation plots were established on each site. The plots were bound by sheet metal borders hammered into the ground on three sides. On the down slope side a collection trough was installed to channel runoff into the measuring flume. If a site was revisited, repeat simulations were always conducted on the same long term plots.</p>
<p>The experimental procedure was as follows. First, the plot was subjected to 45 min, 65 mm/h intensity simulated rainfall (dry run) intended to create initial saturated condition that could be replicated across all sites. This was followed by a 45 minute pause and a second simulation with varying intensity (wet run). During wet runs two modes of water application were used as: rainfall or run-on. Rainfall wet runs typically consisted of series of application rates (65, 100, 125, 150, and 180 mm/h) that were increased after runoff had reached steady state for at least five minutes. Runoff samples were collected on the rising and falling limb of the hydrograph and during each steady state (a minimum of 3 samples). Overland flow velocities were measured during each steady state as previously described. When used, run-on wet runs followed the same procedure as rainfall runs, except water application rates varied between 100 and 300 mm/h. In approximately 20% of simulation experiments the wet run was followed by another simulation (wet2 run) after a 45 min pause. Wet2 runs were similar to wet runs and also consisted of series of varying intensity rainfalls and/or run-on inputs.</p>
<p><strong>Resulting Data</strong><br />
The dataset contains hydrological, erosion, vegetation, and ecological data from 272 rainfall simulation experiments conducted on 12 sq. m plots at 23 rangeland locations in Arizona and Nevada. The experiments were conducted between 2002 and 2013, with some locations being revisited multiple times.</p>

Rangeland Analysis Platform: Monitor rangelands across the USA,"<p>The Rangeland Analysis Platform ( rangelands.app) is a free online application that provides simple and fast access to geospatial vegetation data for U.S. rangelands. The tool was developed to provide landowners, resource managers, conservationists, and scientists access to data that can inform land management planning, decision making, and the evaluation of outcomes. The Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP) uses innovative cloud computing technology to provide maps and analysis opportunities straight to your desktop, delivered securely and instantaneously.</p>
<p>The maps and data provided by RAP are intended to be used alongside local knowledge and site-specific data to inform management actions that improve rangelands and wildlife habitat.</p>
<p><strong>Biomass</strong><br />
The Rangeland Analysis Platform’s vegetation biomass product provides annual and 16-day aboveground biomass from 1986 to present of: annual forbs and grasses, perennial forbs and grasses, and herbaceous (combination of annual and perennial forbs and grasses). Estimates represent accumulated new biomass throughout the year or 16-day period and do not include biomass accumulation in previous years. Aboveground biomass was calculated by separating net primary production (paritioned by functional group) to aboveground and converting carbon to biomass (Jones et al. 2021, Robinson et al. 2019). Estimates are provided in United States customary units (lbs/acre) to facilitate use. Although these data were produced across a broad region, they are primarily intended for rangeland ecosystems. Biomass estimates may not be suitable in other ecosystems, e.g., forests., and are not to be used in agricultural lands, i.e., croplands.</p>
<p><strong>Cover</strong><br />
The Rangeland Analysis Platform’s vegetation cover product provides annual percent cover estimates from 1986 to present of: annual forbs and grasses, perennial forbs and grasses, shrubs, trees, and bare ground. The estimates were produced by combining 75,000 field plots collected by BLM, NPS, and NRCS with the historical Landsat satellite record. Utilizing the power of cloud computing, cover estimates are predicted across the United States at 30m resolution, an area slightly larger than a baseball diamond.</p>
<p><strong>Partitioned NPP</strong><br />
The Rangeland Analysis Platform provides net primary productivity (NPP) estimates from 1986 to present. Estimates are partitioned into the following functional groups: annual forb and grass, perennial forb and grass, shrub, and tree. NPP is the net increase (i.e., photosynthesis minus respiration) in total plant carbon, including above and below ground.</p>

Resampling Validation of Sample Plans (RVSP),"<p>Reliable and cost-effective sampling methods are critical to the development of monitoring systems for pest management and can enhance research activities that address issues in population ecology and population dynamics. Validation and evaluation of these plans are central to development and implementation in the field. Sampling plans are often developed from a restricted range of observations from a small area, but are then used over a wide area representing a novel array of environmental and agronomic conditions.</p>
<p>Sets of tools for sample plan evaluation originally released in 1997, these Monte Carlo simulations can be used to evaluate sampling models during the developmental phase; however, they may not be adequate for testing model validity and performance under field conditions. This is primarily due to the assumption of an underlying statistical distribution (e.g., negative-binomial, normal) which may not adequately represent the actual distributions of insects in all instances. Here we present a method in which actual field data is resampled to evaluate sample plan performance. We originally developed DOS-based computer software for this purpose.  The full functionality of this original program is available as an Excel Add-in in RVSP V.2 compatible with current and past versions of Excel.</p>

"Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, Idaho (Climate)","<p>An extensive, 33 year (1964-1996), climatic database has been developed for three climate stations on the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) located near the north end of the Owyhee Mountains in southwest Idaho.  The longest records (1964-1996) are for daily maximum and minimum temperature.  The length of record for other weather elements that include relative humidity, solar radiation,  wind speed and direction, daily Class A pan evaporation and barometric pressure varies, but in general is from 1974-1996.  Weather sensors have varied from hygrothermographs with spring-driven clocks and charts to electronic sensors with the data telemetered daily to the Northwest Watershed Research Center (NWRC) office in Boise, Idaho. Most of the data, since the early 1980's, were measured and stored electronically, therefore, hourly data are available for most climatic elements between the early 1980's and 1996.  These data can be accessed from the USDA-ARS Northwest Watershed Research Center database.</p>

"Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, Idaho (Discharge)","<p>Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed discharge records are available for 13 stations with varying lengths of record ranging from 8 to 34 years. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Northwest Watershed Research Center initiated a stream discharge and suspended-sediment research program at Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed in the early 1960s. Continuous discharge measurements began at two sites in 1963, at three additional sites in 1964, and at eight additional sites in subsequent years. Contributing areas to these gauging stations range from 1.03 to 23,822 ha, selected to represent the broad range of environmental settings found across northwestern rangelands. Watershed drainage areas range from 1.03 to 23,822 ha with flow characteristics including ephemeral, intermittent, and perennial regimes. Discharge records are available for 13 stations with varying lengths of record ranging from 8 to 34 years. Drop-box weirs have performed well in RCEW over a wide range of discharges and sediment loads. Four additional types of stream-gauging devices are used in RCEW: (1) self-cleaning overflow V-notch (SCOV) weir, (2) 30 V-notch weir, (3) 90 V-notch weir, and (4) Parshall flume. All stations are equipped with stilling wells and floats for obtaining instantaneous measures of stage height. Instrument shelters are heated to permit collection of discharge and sediment data during cold winter periods. Gauging stations are visited on a weekly or biweekly basis to obtain independent stage height readings for error checking and to service all instrumentation. Stage height measurements were originally recorded using Leopold-Stevens A-35 and FW-1 strip chart recorders, later supplanted by electronic data loggers.</p>

"Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, Idaho (Lysimeter)","<p>Lysimeters are instruments that measure water and/or solute movement in soils. The primary purpose for these lysimeters was to measure evapotranspiration (ET); these data describe changes in soil water during the snow-free season. In addition to measuring changes in total soil water, soil water content profiles and soil temperature profiles were measured within or adjacent to the lysimeters and are reported. Two pairs of soil lysimeters were installed in the RCEW in 1967, one pair at the Lower Sheep Creek climate station (designated the east and west lysimeters), separated, center to center, by 3.6 m, and the other pair at the Reynolds Mountain climate station (designated north and south), separated by 4.7 m. These lysimeters were hydraulic weighing lysimeters in which an inner cylindrical tank containing soil is set within a slightly larger outer cylinder. The inner cylinder rests on a coil of 0.05 m diameter butyl tubing filled with liquid (different low-freezing point liquids were used). The inner cylinder was 1.22 m deep and 1.47 m in diameter. The butyl tubing was hydraulically connected underground to a pressure transducer or manometer. The soil in each lysimeter was extracted from near the lysimeter sites. A soil core was taken by repeatedly excavating a soil cylinder of slightly larger diameter than the lysimeter and forcing the lysimeter sleeve over the soil to the depth of the sleeve (1.22 m). A metal plate was then forced across the cylinder bottom and welded to it in place. The inner cylinder, thus filled with soil, was then transported to the previously excavated outer cylinder via crane and set on the butyl tubing. A neutron probe access tube was installed in the center of each lysimeter to monitor soil water content changes with depth, and two 1.2 m ceramic suction ""candles"" were placed at the bottom of the lysimeters through a separate entrance. This operation resulted in an undisturbed soil monolith with extant vegetation in place. This is critical for two reasons: (1) Growing native vegetation under natural conditions is problematic in this environment, and plant development is slow. (2) The soil horizonation, particularly the argillic and calcic horizons which are both strongly embedded in coarse fragments, would be essentially impossible to reproduce artificially.</p>

"Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, Idaho (Precipitation)","<p>An extensive precipitation database has been developed over the past 35 years with the first records starting in January 1962 and going through September 1996 from the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed located near the north end of the Owyhee Mountains in southwest Idaho.  Precipitation ranges from 236 mm on the lowest elevations at the north end of the watershed to 1123 mm at the southwest corner of the watershed.  The gauge network was changed in 1967-1968 from a single unshielded, universal-recording gauge at each location to the dual-gauge system that is presently used.  The dualgauge system consists of an unshielded and a shielded universal-recording gauge with orifices 3.05 m above the ground.  The number of dual-gauge sites was reduced from the original 46 in 1968 to 17 by 1996.  Also, several sites have been added and/or taken out of the network at various times for special studies.  There are continuous 35 year records available for 12 sites, 20-32 year records available for 8 sites, 10-19 year records available for 25 sites, and 4-9 year records for 8 sites for a total of 53 sites.

"Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, Idaho (Sediment)","<p>Automated Sigma pump samplers were used at all RCEW gauging stations to collect instantaneous point measures of suspended-sediment concentration. The US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Northwest Watershed Research Center initiated a stream discharge and suspended-sediment research program at Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed in the early 1960s. Samples of suspended-sediment concentration were collected at Outlet, Tollgate, and Reynolds Mountain East gauging stations starting in the 1960s and continuing to the present. In early years, samples were collected manually during storm events using integrated samplers at the large weirs or simple grab samples at the smaller weirs. Later, a variety of early sediment samplers such as the U.S. PS-67 and U.S. PS-69 pumping samplers were tested and used in RCEW through cooperative efforts with other Agricultural Research Service locations, federal and state agencies, and universities. In recent years, automated Sigma pump samplers have been used at all gauging stations to collect a continuous record of instantaneous point measures of suspended-sediment concentration during high and low flows. Drop-box weirs have also performed well in RCEW over a wide range of discharges and sediment loads.

"Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, Idaho (Soil Temperature)","<p>Long-term soil temperature data were collected at the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed (RCEW) from 1981-1996 at five locations representing different climatic regimes and soils in the RCEW, ranging in elevation from 1190 to 2101 m. Each site is located in close proximity to a climate station on nearly level slopes. In most sites, there were six or seven measurement depths ranging from 2.5 to 240 cm; in 1990, new sensors were installed at all sites at depths of 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120, and 180 cm. Each soil temperature depth profile is located near at least one neutron access tube and a precipitation gauge, and complete climate station information was collected either at the site or in reasonable proximity. Regular data collection started in 1981 or 1982, depending on the site. The temperature sensors used were YSI (Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, Ohio) two-thermistor composite thermolinear components accurate to 0.15C. Data were originally collected in 1981 by connecting a hand-held voltmeter to the sensor leads, and individual sensors at different depths were read using a manual switch. These data were collected once each week, and the time was recorded. At some sites the switches were bypassed and hooked up to data loggers of various design resulting in more frequent (either 1 or 4 hour) recording intervals. Prior to 1990, soil temperature sensors were installed by attaching the sensors to a 0.05 m diameter wooden pole at the desired depth intervals, drilling a hole a with a drill rig (the soils in the RCEW are very rocky), inserting the pole in the drilled hole, and backfilling.</p>

"Rodent data from trapping webs in the long-term Small Mammal Exclusion Study (SMES) at Jornada Basin LTER, 1995-2007","<p>This data package contains rodent trapping data from plots with various levels of herbivore exclusion on the Jornada Experimental Range (JER) and Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) lands. Study sites were established in 1995; one in black grama grassland and the other in creosotebush shrubland to compare the impact of herbivores on ecosystem processes between these vegetation types. Parallel studies were established at the Sevilleta LTER site (New Mexico, USA) and Mapimi Biosphere Reserve (Durango, Mexico). Each study site is 1 km by 0.5 km in area. Three replicate rodent trapping webs and four replicate experimental blocks were randomly located at each study site. Rodent trapping webs were used to measure rodent population density and species diversity over time, while the experimental blocks measure vegetation responses to herbivore exclusion treatments including a) all mammalian herbivores, including cattle, lagomorphs, and rodents, b) lagomorphs and cattle only, c) cattle only, and d) control accessible to all herbivores. Rodent populations were sampled from each of the three webs at each study site during overnight trapping campaigns twice per year, in the early (April-May) and late (September-October) summer between 1995 and 2007 (trapping study terminated after October 2007). During each trapping campaign, live-traps were left open for three consecutive nights, and captured animals were recorded on the three subsequent mornings. Each animal caught was identified, measured, and released at the same location where it was captured. This study is complete.</p>

SGA (farm),"<p><strong>What is Stored Grain Advisor?</strong></p>
<p>Stored Grain Advisor (SGA) is a decision support system for the managemement of insect pests of farm-stored wheat. SGA predicts the likelihood of insect infestation, and recommends preventative and remedial action. It also provides advice on how to sample and identify insect pests of stored wheat.</p>
<p>Computer models of insect population growth allow SGA to predict future insect populations in the grain bin, as well as the breakdown of insecticides, the effects of fumigation, and cooling the wheat with aeration. The ability of Stored Grain Advisor to graphically show insect population trends makes it a powerful educational tool.</p>

This Surface Composite contains data for the ARM/GCIP NESOB 1997 time period (01 April 1997 through 31 March 1998) and for the ARM/GCIP NESOB 1997 domain only. The ARM/GCIP NESOB 1997 domain is approximately 34N to 39N latitude and 94.5W to 100.5W longitude. The ARM/GCIP NESOB 1997 Hourly Surface Composite contains ten metadata parameters and 38 data parameters and flags. The metadata parameters describe the station location and time at which the data were collected. The time of observation is reported both in Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) Nominal and UTC actual time. Days begin at UTC hour 0100 and end at UTC hour 0000 the following day. The data parameters are valid for the reported times. Missing values are reported as 9's in the data field. Several data parameters have an associated Quality Control (QC) Flag Code which is assigned during the Joint Office for Science Support (JOSS) quality control processing; data were never changed, only flagged. When not present in the raw data, the dewpoint is computed using the formula from Bolton (1980). Calculated Sea Level pressure is computed from station pressure, temperature, dewpoint, and station elevation using the formula of Wallace and Hobbs (1977). Specific Humidity values were computed from dew point and station pressure using formulas from Wexler and Wildhack (1963). The squall/gust wind speed data were not quality controlled.</p>

"SGP97 GCIP/NESOB Surface: Sensible, Latent and Ground Heat Flux Composite","<p>This 30 minute Sensible, Latent and Ground Heat Flux Composite is one of two surface-layer flux data sets provided in the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement(ARM)/Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Continental-Scale International Project (GCIP) Near Surface Observation Data Set - 1997 (NESOB-97). This Sensible, Latent and Ground Heat Flux composite was formed from three data sources: the ARM Southern Great Plains (SGP) Clouds and Radiation Testbed (CART) Energy Balance/Bowen Ratio (EBBR) sites, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Atmospheric Turbulence and Diffusion Division (ATDD) Little Washita Watershed site, and the ARM SGP Eddy Correlation (ECOR) sites. Data from 14 ARM/EBBR stations, 1 NOAA/ATDD station, and 8 ARM/ECOR stations were merged to form this composite. The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research/Joint Office for Science Support (UCAR/JOSS) did not do any quality control on the data set. Heat flux sensors consist of a differential temperature sensor which measures heat flow. Heat flux is a vector quantity of energy flowing through a 1 meter square surface in one second. Sensible heat flux is the transfer of sensible heat between the surface and the air, or vice versa. Latent heat flux is the transfer of latent heat (heat released or absorbed by water) between the surface and the air, or vice versa. Ground, or soil, heat flux is the transfer of sensible heat in the soil, either toward the surface or away from the surface. The Little Washita site records only 1 soil heat flux value. The EBBR sites record soil heat flux values from 5 different sensors. The ARM soil sensors are located in a half-circle approximately 2 meters in diameter under the net radiometer, which extends to the south about 1 meter from the EBBR frame. The soil conditions at the EBBR sites are varied from very sandy soil to very clay-laden soil. However, all of the sensors for one particular EBBR site are in the same soil type. Information on the soil characteristics at each of the ARM Soil Water and Temperature System (SWATS) sites (which are located nearby the ARM EBBR sites) is available as part of the ARM/GCIP NESOB-97. (These include the ""Organic Carbon and Matter"", ""Soil Texture"", ""Parameters for Soil Water Retention Models"", ""Bulk Density"", Particle Size"", and ""Soil Water Retention"" data sets). The EBBR sites also record Bowen Ratio, home_15 and home_30 values, as well, whereas the Little Washita site does not. Since this is a composite data set, only the first 3 fields of data from the Little Washita site will have values, while the rest of the parameters on a line will always be missing. Missing values are -999.99999.<br />

This dataset contains cloud height data collected using the ARMCART SGP Belfort Laser Ceilometer (BLC) Model 7013C and the ARMCART SGP MicroPulse Lidar (MPL) located at station E13: Lamont Central Facility 1 (CF1). This dataset contains data from these two instruments located within the NESOB 1997 domain (94.5 W to 100.5 W longitude and 34 N to 39 N latitude) for the NESOB 1997 time period (01 April 1997 through 31 March 1998). The data in this dataset were formed by extracting 30 minute cloud height data from 60 second BLC data in netCDF format. A zero for the first cloud layer signifies no clouds detected within the limit of the instrument field of view and range. A cloud ht of zero for the second and third cloud layers indicates an unknown cloud height (i.e. the ceiliometer can't see through lower clouds). These zeros are reported as ""0.00000 U"" in the data. The ARMCART Belfort Laser Ceilometer data contains eight metadata parameters and eight data parameters and flags. The metadata parameters describe the date, network, station and location at which the data were collected. Data values are collected at the time of observation. All times are UTC.</p>

The NCEP Daily Precipitation dataset was formed by extracting incremental precipitation values. The value reported for any daily observation represents data collected during the previous 24 hours. The Daily Precipitation Composite contains six metadata parameters and four data parameters. The metadata parameters describe the station location and time at which the data were collected. The four data parameters repeat once for each day in the monthly record. Every record has 31 days reported, regardless of the actual number of days in the month. For months with less than 31 days, the extra days are reported as missing (i.e., '-999.99 7 M'). Each 24 hour precipitation value has an associated observation hour.

Most investigators studying grasslands have assumed that the low standing biomass of the SGS created a system with a low probability of carrying fire, and thus a minimal historical role of fire. Nonetheless, there are years with aboveground biomass equivalent to the mixed grass prairie, and a high frequency of lightening storms. Regardless of the historical role of fire in SGS, there are new questions regarding its utility in managing for the presence of the threatened mountain plover, which only nests in areas of low plant biomass. United States Forest Service, Pawnee National Grassland recently initiated a burning program in the mid 1990s to address questions about using fire to increase plover habitat; we have collected data on some of these plots to investigate the influence of fire on SGS vegetation. Several datasets were created between 1999 and 2004 by SGS-LTER researchers, including measurements of shrub and cactus mortality rates, aboveground net primary production, amounts of litter and standing dead, and aboveground nitrogen dynamics in burned and control plots in the western section of the Pawnee National Grassland.

The Breeding Bird Survey is a large-scale survey of North American birds. It is a roadside survey, primarily covering the continental United States and southern Canada, although survey routes have recently been initiated in Alaska and northern Mexico. The BBS was started in 1966, and the over 3,500 routes are surveyed in June by experienced birders. Routes 305, Nunn and 901, Rockport are located in the area of the SGS research site. The primary objective of the BBS has been the estimation of population change for songbirds. However, the data have many potential uses, and investigators have used the data to address a variety of research and management objectives. In the USGS-BBS Home Page, reults from the BBS are summarized, and pictures of birds and other species information. Data from 1966 - 2002 were managed by the SGS-LTER project.

Six sites approximately 6 km apart were selected at the Central Plains Experimental Range in 1997. Within each site, there was a pair of adjacent ungrazed and moderately summer grazed (40-60% removal of annual aboveground production by cattle) locations. Grazed locations had been grazed from 1939 to present and ungrazed locations had been protected from 1991 to present by the establishment of exclosures. Within grazed and ungrazed locations, all tillers and root crowns of B. gracilis were removed from two treatment plots (3 m x 3 m) with all other vegetation undisturbed. Two control plots were established adjacent to the treatment plots. Plant density was measured annually by species in a fixed 1m x 1m quadrat in the center of treatment and control plots. For clonal species, an individual plant was defined as a group of tillers connected by a crown Coffin & Lauenroth 1988, Fair et al. 1999). Seedlings were counted as separate individuals. In the same quadrat, basal cover by species, bare soil, and litter were estimated annually using a point frame. A total of 40 points were read from four locations halfway between the center point and corners of the 1m x 1m quadrat. Density was measured from 1998 to 2005 and cover from 1997 to 2006.

The importance of disturbance intensity and herbivory by cattle and white grubs, or the larvae of June beetles to recovery of shortgrass steppe ecosystems in Colorado, USA were evaluated over a 14 year time period. Disturbance intensity was defined by survival of the dominant grass species (Bouteloua gracilis) after an outbreak of root feeding activity by white grubs. 16 patches of vegetation consisting of four pairs of adjacent ungrazed-grazed by cattle locations with 2 replicates that were recently affected by white grubs were selected in 1977. Disturbance intensity was determined in 1977 by the area in each patch that contained live tillers of B. gracilis. Permanent plots were lcoated both within and outside of each patch. Plant basal cover and density by species were estimated at time of peak aboveground biomass in 6 different years on each plot. Successional dynamics on patches was similar to areas affected by other types of disturbances, however, rate of recovery was faster for patches affected by grubs. Grazing by cattle was infrequently important to plant recovery, a result similar to effects of grazing on other aspects of shortgrass steppe. Disturbance intensity was important to recovery of B. gracilis since tiller survival in 1977 was linearly related to cover in each year of sampling. For ungrazed patches, initial conditions were important to recovery of B. gracilis for as many as 14 years. For grazed patches, initial conditions decreased and grazing increased in importance through time. Changes in resource quality and more uniform distribution of roots due to grazing likely resulted in more complete mortality of plants by grubs under grazed compared to ungrazed conditions. Persistance of shortgrass steppe ecosystems in spite of disturbances with different intensities are determined at least in part by characteristics of disturbances interacting with the ability ofplants to respond, and in part by the evolutionary history of the system. Although white grubs affect shortgrass communities infrequently, they have large and important effects on plant community structure through time, and represent an important class of disturbance defined by intensity.</p>

Our research on abandoned fields at the CPER has two aspects,vegetation recovery and soil recovery. We wish to monitor these fields for the tem of the LTER project (decades or centuries), and to address some specific research questions. Our questions are: 1. Does vegetation on shortgrass steppe recover 55 years following cultivation? Specifically, does Bouteloua gracilis, the dominant shortgrass steppe species, recover? Prior results indicated that B. gracilis reovers on some fields, and does not on others. The fields that do not are dominated by buffalo grass. In this new work at the CPER, we ask an additional question: 2. What determines whether B. gracilis recovers? 3. Does soil organic matter recover following abandonment? Specifically, do indices of soil fertility such as nitrogen availability recover? 4. Does small-scale patterning associated with individual plants recover following disturbance? 5. Does the rate of soil recovery depend upon the rate of vegetation recovery? Past results on the Pawnee National Grasslands indicated that only small amounts of organic matter had accumulated following abandonment but that nitrogen availability had recovered to its original levels under B. gracilis plants on the abandoned fields. Specifically, we are interested in whether it makes a difference to soils if blue grama recovers or not.

Later sampling from 1982 to 1991 showed a ten-fold increase in exotic weed species on the water plus nitrogen plots as compared to the controls (Milchunas and Lauenroth 1995), a community change that has persisted on this site due to a chronic elevation of soil nitrogen caused by a plant tissue/soil organic matter feedback mechanism (Vinton and Burke 1995). In 1998, Six new treatments were superimposed on the historic study site. The six new treatments were: control, sugar, lignin, sawdust, lignin and sugar, and sawdust and sugar.In 2010, plots will be sampled every 5 years. Our objective in this study is to examine how plant communities change through time and explore implications of these changes for monitoring potentially stressed ecosystems.

When the CPER was established in 1939, researchers constructed a .5-1 ha grazing exclosure in each of the pastures. These areas have remained protected from grazing for the past 70 years. The remaining areas have been grazed for the past 20+ years. This collection of pastures and exclosures provided an extraordinary opportunity to reinitiate grazing and protection, and evaluate the balance between degradation and aggradation. We proposed to rearrange fences and expose areas to grazing that have been protected for 50 years, and protect areas from grazing that had been grazed for 50 years. The combinations of grazing conditions were: 1. Long-term protection 2.

The objective of this research is to evaluate the long-term response of shortgrass ecosystems to additional water and nitrogen inputs. An experiment was conducted during the IBP project (1970-1975) in which water and nitrogen were applied (Lauenroth et al. 1978, Dodd and Lauenroth 1979, Milchunas and Lauenroth 1995). While we gained an enormous increment in our knowledge about shortgrass ecosystems from this experiment it raised as many questions as it answered. One of the problems was that the treatments were very high levels of nitrogen (100-150kg/ha N) and water (600 mm/growing season) additions.

Carbon (C) sequestration potential in grasslands is thought to be high due to the large soil organic carbon pools characteristic of these ecosystems. Inputs of C (aboveground net primary productivity) are highly correlated to precipitation across the Great Plains region; however, changes in C pool size at a specific site are governed by the relative input and output rates across time. Our objective was to quantify the ecosystem C response of three grassland community types (shortgrass steppe, mixed grass and tallgrass prairie) to interannual variation in precipitation. At five sites across a precipitation gradient in the Great Plains, we measured net primary production (NPP), soil respiration (SRESP), and litter decomposition rates for three consecutive years. NPP, SRESP, and litter decomposition increased from shortgrass steppe (175, 454, and 47 g C m-2 yr-1) to tallgrass prairie (408, 1221, and 348 g C m-2 yr-1 for NPP, SRESP, and litter decomposition respectively). Increased growing season precipitation between study years resulted in increased NPP, SRESP, and litter decomposition at almost all sites. However, the regional patterns of the interannual NPP, SRESP, and litter decomposition responses differ from each other. This data suggests NPP and SRESP are more sensitive to interannual changes in precipitation than litter decomposition, and that shortgrass steppe sites are more responsive to interannual variability in precipitation than mixed grass and tallgrass prairie.</p>

We investigated the use of prairie dog towns by cattle (Bos taurus) on the shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado by conducting surveys of cattle and vegetation from June to August 1999. Cattle presence and behavior were recorded 3 times a week during driving surveys of 15 black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) towns. A subset of 3 pastures with prairie dog towns was intensively surveyed twice weekly wherein the habitat and activity of a randomly chosen focal animal was recorded every 6 minutes for 3.5 hours. Bite and step counts of other individuals were recorded for 5-minute intervals. Vegetation height and cover data were collected monthly on each of 6 habitats. Results from driving surveys and intensively surveyed pastures were similar; cattle neither significantly preferred nor avoided prairie dog towns. Bare ground cover on prairie dog towns did not significantly differ from most other habitats, but vegetation on prairie dog towns was significantly shorter on (mean = 6.7 cm) than that off (mean = 11.9 cm) prairie dog towns. Nevertheless, foraging observations indicated that there was no significant difference between cattle foraging rates on swales (70.9 bites/min) and prairie dog towns (69.5 bites/min). Thus, cattle on the shortgrass steppe appear to use prairie dog towns in proportion to their availability and, while there, they graze as intensively as they do on habitats not inhabited by prairie dogs.</p>

In a 10-year study, we assessed the influence of five carbon (C) treatments on the labile C and nitrogen (N) pools of historically N enriched plots on the Shortgrass Steppe Long Term Ecological Research site located in northeastern Colorado. For eight years, we applied sawdust, sugar, industrial lignin, sawdust + sugar, and lignin + sugar to plots that had received N and water additions in the early 1970s. Previous work showed that past water and N additions altered plant species composition and enhanced rates of nutrient cycling; these effects were still apparent 25 years later. We hypothesized that labile C amendments would stimulate microbial activity and suppress rates of N mineralization, whereas complex forms of carbon (sawdust and lignin) could enhance humification and lead to longer-term reductions in N availability. Results indicated that of the five carbon treatments, sugar, sawdust, and sawdust + sugar suppressed N availability, with sawdust + sugar being the most effective treatment to reduce N availability. The year after treatments stopped, N availability remained less in the sawdust + sugar treatment plots than in the high-N control plots. Three years after treatments ended, reductions in N availability were smaller (40-60%). Our results suggest that highly labile forms of carbon generate strong short- term N sinks, but these effects dissipate within one year of application, and that more recalcitrant forms reduce N longer. Sawdust + sugar was the most effective treatment to decrease exotic species canopy cover and increase native species density over the long term. Labile carbon had neither short- nor long-term effects on exotic species. Even though the organic amendments did not contribute to recovery of the dominant native species Bouteloua gracilis, they were effective in increasing another native species, Carex eleocharis. These results indicate that organic amendments may be a useful tool for restoring some native species in the shortgrass steppe.</p>

Body size is a fundamental biological measurement that is known to be related to an organism&#39;s physiology, life-history and ecology. Estimates of body size are also widely used in comparative evolutionary and ecological studies, including food web and diet studies that require estimates of biomass. Beginning in 1994, small mammals are live-trapped twice each year on the three grassland and three shrubland trapping webs. Individuals are weighed (to nearest 0.5 g using a Pesola spring scale) when first captured during a given trapping session but not upon recapture during the same session. Weights are calculated by subtracting the weight of an empty capture (ziploc) bag from the weight of animal in the bag. Individuals are classified into age classes (adult, subadult, juvenile) in the field based on a combination of size and pelage characteristics. This dataset gives means, standard deviations, minimum and maximum values for body weight, in grams, of small mammals captured between September 1994 and September 2008. All sites and sampling periods were combined. Most individuals (~93%) were classified as new captures, although a few individuals that were captured multiple times across different trapping sessions may appear in the dataset more than once. Values may differ from estimates calculated using the entire capture dataset because age and weight data were screened more closely to omit obvious errors and outliers.</p>

Small mammals (rabbits, rodents) are integral components of semiarid ecosystems because of their roles as consumers of plants, seeds and arthropods, as soil disturbance agents, and as food for raptors, snakes and mammalian carnivores. Because of their vagility and intermediate trophic position, populations of small mammals may track changes in vegetation and the abiotic environment that may result from shifts in land-use and other anthropogenic disturbances. However, these populations are variable over space and time, and their response to environmental changes may not be immediately apparent given their behavioral flexibility and relatively long life-spans and generation times. Patterns in the distribution and abundance of small mammals thus may simultaneously reflect and affect the stability of the shortgrass-steppe ecosystem. Long-term studies of population and community dynamics therefore are needed to fully understand the role of small mammals in grassland ecosystems. In 1994, we implemented a sampling scheme to monitor long-term changes in relative abundance of small mammals in representative habitats of shortgrass steppe. We live-trapped nocturnal rodents twice each year (spring, late summer) on trapping webs in upland prairie (GRASS) and saltbush-dominated (SHRUB) habitats. Three 3.14-ha webs were established in each habitat. Each web had 124 Sherman traps, which were spaced 10-m apart on 12 100-m spokes, with 30 degrees between spokes. Four traps were set in the center of the web. Traps were set for four consecutive nights in each trapping session. Traps are baited with a mix of peanut butter and oats, set in the evening and checked (and closed) at dawn. We recorded sex, age and weight upon first capture of all individuals. In the early years of the study, individuals were batch-marked (Sharpie colored felt markers) to distinguish recaptures from new individuals, providing the minimum information necessary to use distance-sampling methods to estimate density. Most nocturnal species are now usually marked with aluminum ear tags, although we continue to mark very small (pocket mice) or small-eared (voles) species only with felt pens. For ear-tagged animals, we distinguish new captures (N) from individuals marked during previous sessions (old, O), versus those that are recaptured (R) on 2nd, 3rd or 4th nights of a trapping session. The location of one trapping web was changed from 13NE (1994-1997) to 13SW (1998- present) because of concerns about intensive cattle use in the pasture, as well as activity of CPER Site Manager’s cats.</p>

Small mammals (rabbits, rodents) are integral components of semiarid ecosystems because of their roles as consumers of plants, seeds and arthropods, as soil disturbance agents, and as food for raptors, snakes and mammalian carnivores. Because of their vagility and intermediate trophic position, populations of small mammals may track changes in vegetation and the abiotic environment that may result from shifts in land-use and other anthropogenic disturbances. However, these populations are variable over space and time, and their response to environmental changes may not be immediately apparent given their behavioral flexibility and relatively long life-spans and generation times. Patterns in the distribution and abundance of small mammals thus may simultaneously reflect and affect the stability of the shortgrass-steppe ecosystem. Long-term studies of population and community dynamics therefore are needed to fully understand the role of small mammals in grassland ecosystems. Thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus, SPTR) are the most widely distributed rodent species in shortgrass steppe and the most important in terms of abundance and biomass. Like most rodents in shortgrass steppe, they are omnivorous; unlike other species, however, they are diurnal and active aboveground only 5-6 months each year, and therefore required a separate sampling scheme from other rodents. In 1999, we initiated studies to track long-term changes in relative abundance of ground squirrels in representative habitats of shortgrass steppe. We live-trapped squirrels twice each year, which corresponded to periods of high aboveground activity of adults (early June, SPR) and the emergence of juveniles (mid-July, SUM). Three 3.14-ha webs were established in upland prairie (GRASS) and saltbush-dominated (SHRUB) habitats. Each web had 62 Sherman traps, which were spaced 20-m apart on 12 100-m spokes, with 30 degrees between spokes. Two traps were set in the center of the web. Traps were set for four consecutive mornings in each trapping session. Traps were baited with a mix of peanut butter and oats, set at dawn and closed 4-6 hours later. Traps were shaded with pieces of PVC pipe to reduce heat mortality in traps. We recorded sex, age and weight upon first capture of all individuals. Because the ears of squirrels are too small to consistently hold ear tags, all individuals were batch-marked with a colored Sharpie felt marker to distinguish recaptures ® from new (N) individuals, providing the minimum information necessary to use distance-sampling methods to estimate density. NOTE: In this dataset, ages and weights may not correspond well. Weight, combined with sampling date, can be used to better determine age class; contact Paul Stapp for more information.</p>

The abundance and diversity of small mammals in shortgrass steppe is strongly influenced by the structure and composition of vegetation. Vegetation structure provides cover from predators and harsh abiotic conditions. Plant species composition affects the types of seeds and herbaceous material available to granivores and herbivores, and influences arthropod populations, which are important prey for the omnivorous species that dominate in shortgrass steppe. Both vegetation structure and plant community composition are sensitive to the availability of precipitation as well as the activity of large mammalian herbivores. In 1999, we began measuring vegetation structure and plant community composition on the three grassland and three shrubland trapping webs where we live-trap small mammals. Vegetation measurements are made once each year, usually in mid-July. Percent canopy cover of each plant species was estimated visually in 30 0.10-m2 Daubenmire quadrats on each web. To estimate habitat structure, we measured the height of grass, forb and shrub plants adjacent to each quadrat, the density of half-shrubs, small mammal mounds and burrows, harvester ant mounds and the dimensions of large shrubs and animal mounds.</p>

With the exception of heteromyids, eg kangaroo rats and pocket mice, most small rodents in shortgrass steppe are omnivorous. Depending on season, arthropods (insects and arachnids) make up 40-85% of the diet of grasshopper mice and thirteen-lined ground squirrels, the most widespread rodents in northern shortgrass steppe. Small mammals are among the most important predators of ground-dwelling macroarthropods and herbivorous insects provide a direct resource link between weather and plant production. Understanding temporal variability in the abundance of arthropods is central to determining the mechanisms that drive small rodent populations. At present, there are no long-term studies of arthropods in shortgrass steppe, despite the important role that these taxa play in grassland food webs. Beginning in 1998, we implemented field protocols to track changes in relative abundance of terrestrial macroarthropods in grassland and shrub-dominated habitats of shortgrass steppe. Sampling was conducted on the six trapping webs (three upland prairie, three lowland saltbush) where we studied rodent populations, and was conducted approximately monthly from May-September (4-5 sessions/year). Ground-dwelling macroarthropods were sampled on each web using pitfall traps, set in one four-by-five grid, with 10 m between traps. Traps consisted of plastic cups (90-mm diameter, 120 mm deep), including a plastic funnel (90-mm diameter), buried flush with the ground surface. Traps were shaded with wooden covers held in place with nails; traps could be closed when not operational by nailing the cover flush to the ground. Traps were usually open for 4 consecutive days (ie 80 trap-days) during a trapping session. On the 4th day, captured arthropods were removed from the traps, identified and released. All arthropods were identified to the ordinal level; beetles (Coleoptera), crickets (Orthoptera), true bugs (Hemiptera) and spiders were identified to the familial level; and a few taxa, eg tenebrionid beetles, were identified to species. We also recorded any reptiles and amphibians captured. The number of individuals of each taxa captured per 100 trap-days was used as an index of relative abundance, with adjustments made for traps that were flooded or disturbed by cattle or for changes to the number of days that traps were open (range 4-7 days). We sampled grasshoppers by counting the numbers flushed from 0.78-m2 circular plots (hoops) placed on each web. Hoops were set out on the day that pitfall traps were opened and were surveyed on the day that traps were closed. A technician used a wooden lath to flush and count all grasshoppers from each hoop. Grasshoppers were not identified to species. Surveys were conducted in 1998, then were discontinued until 2002. In 1998 and from 2002-2005, nine hoops were sampled on each web. Beginning in 2006, we sampled a total of 20 hoops on each web.</p>

Carnivores are among the most conspicuous, charismatic and economically important mammals in shortgrass steppe, yet relatively is little is known about their populations or of the ecological factors that determine their distribution and abundance, in part because densities tend to be low. Mammalian carnivores represent the top predators in grassland food webs, consuming rodents, rabbits, young ungulates and other small vertebrates. In addition, shortgrass steppe is the primary habitat of the swift fox (Vulpes velox), a species of special conservation concern throughout most of its range. Fox populations are thought to be limited by predation from coyotes (Canis latrans), the most common carnivore in these grasslands and a species of interest, both for its ecological roles and well as a target species for human exploitation, ie hunting and predator control. In 1994, we implemented a low-intensity sampling scheme to monitor long-term changes in relative abundance of mammalian carnivores and help us examine interactions between these predators and their small mammal prey, including rodents and rabbits. We estimated relative abundance of carnivores using scat surveys along a fixed route. Four times each year (January, April, July, October), we drove a 32-km route consisting of pasture two-track and gravel roads on the CPER. We first drove the route to remove all scats (‘PRE-census’); we then returned ~14 d later and counted the number of scats deposited on the route (‘CENSUS’). We recorded the species that deposited the scat and estimated the scat age based on external appearance (4 categories). Beginning in 1997, we recorded the vegetation (habitat) type and topographic position of all scat locations to describe habitat use. Latrines are indicated by locations containing multiple scats. We used the ‘CENSUS’ data to calculate a scat index, defined as the number of scats deposited per km of road per night. The scat index can be used to estimate population density using equations for coyotes (Knowlton 1982) and swift foxes (Schauster et al. 2002) that described the rate of scat deposition from surveys where density was known. To estimate density and compare trends among seasons and years, we omitted scats collected along the 8.3 km of the route that occurred on gravel county roads. These roads are graded sporadically, sometimes between pre-census and census surveys, which tended to remove scats. (NOTE: these observations are NOT omitted in the dataset).</p>

Rabbits are the most important small-mammal herbivores in shortgrass steppe, and may significant influence the physiognomy and population dynamics of herbaceous plants and woody shrubs. Rabbits also are the most important prey of mammalian carnivores such as coyotes and large raptors such as golden eagles and great horned owls. Two hares (Lepus californicus, L. townsendii) and one cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus audubonii) occur in shortgrass steppe. In 1994, we initiated long-term studies to track changes in relative abundance of rabbits on the Central Plains Experimental Range (CPER). On four nights each year (one night each season, usually on new moon nights in January, April, July, October), we drove a 32-km route consisting of pasture two-track and gravel roads on the CPER.

The belowground system in arid and semiarid regions can be of relatively greater importance than in more mesic systems because plant competition is most often for soil water rather than for light in aboveground canopies. Belowground plant biomass in the shortgrass steppe represents approximately 80% of the total. These data, entitled Long-Term Seasonal Root Biomass, were obtained in section 21 of the Central Plains Experimental Range from 1985-2008 in conjunction with a 14C labeling experiment designed to test isotope methods of estimating root production. Paired plots for each of eight replicate 14C labeled plots were established and cored on average six times per year over 13 years (five cores each plot each date as above). There were two primary objectives for collecting these data, 1) to compare estimates of root production (or belowground net primary production - BNPP) obtained using the sequential coring of biomass methods with various isotope, minirhizotron, ingrowth, and other methods, and 2) to examine long-term controls on the temporal dynamics of root biomass. This shortgrass steppe LTER site is the only place we are aware of that has compared most methods of estimating BNPP, including sequential coring, ingrowth cores, and ingrowth donuts, 14C pulse-isotope dilution, 14C pulse-isotope turnover, rhizotron windows, and minirhizotron, and indirect methods including nitrogen budget, carbon flux, simulation carbon flow model, and regression model. All production methods are compared in Milchunas (2009), and more detailed comparisons among particular methods can be found in Milchunas and Lauenroth (1992, 2001), and Milchunas et al. (2005a, and 2005b). Results and conclusions concerning root biomass dynamics and relationships with precipitation, season, and aboveground biomass are reported primarily in Milchunas and Lauenroth (2001).

Nonetheless, there are years with aboveground biomass equivalent to the mixed grass prairie, and a high frequency of lightening storms.

CPER Paleopedology Study – Pedons - Forty-one pedons representing sites of contrasting geomorphic position (upland plain, upland ridge, dissected upland, terrace, dune) were chosen for pedologic and geomorphic analyses. These pedons are located on the major physiographic units at the CPER, and contain deposits of suspected fluvial and eolian origin. To examine spatial variability, the pedons were typically sampled along transects spaced at 30m intervals. Samples were taken with a hydraulic soil probe to the depth of probe refusal and from suitable stream and road cuts. All soils were described and sampled by genetic horizon (Soil Survey Staff, 1992), and analyzed at Colorado State University. Analyses included particle size and organic C. Nineteen of the 41 pedons were subjected to stable isotopic analysis of organic C and carbonate.

CPER Paleopedology Study – Particle and Grain Size - Grain size data from 39 pedons were compared with modal fluvial (7) and eolian (3) samples in order to characterize the origin of CPER parent materials and distinguish the origin of CPER geomorphic features. The seven fluvial sites were located along Owl and Eastman Creeks. The three eolian sites were located on the nearest undisputed dune fields located approximately 5 km north of Roggen, CO (Muhs, 1985). For statistical analysis, the sand and coarse silt fractions were shaken in a nest of half phi(0) interval sieves ranging from -1.0 0 (10 mesh) to 4.5 0 (325 mesh) for 3 minutes. Phi intervals (-log2) were utilized to normalize the particle size data for use in conventional statistics (Krumbein, 1934). The silt and clay fractions were separated by sedimentation using the pipette method. Statistical methods adopted from Folk and Ward (1957) were applied to the -1.0 0 to 7.0 0 fractions using the Sedimentary Petrology Computer Program SEDPET (Warner, 1970) to determine mean grain size (Mz), sorting (Iz), skewness (Skz), and kurtosis (Kz). These parameters were then subjected to univariate and bivariate analysis. The clay fraction was not included in the statistical computations to avoid excessively fine skewing the sample.

The Breeding Bird Survey is a large-scale survey of North American birds. It is a roadside survey, primarily covering the continental United States and southern Canada, although survey routes have recently been initiated in Alaska and northern Mexico. The BBS was started in 1966, and the over 3,500 routes are surveyed in June by experienced birders. Routes 305, Nunn and 901, Rockport are located in the area of the SGS research site. The primary objective of the BBS has been the estimation of population change for songbirds. However, the data have many potential uses, and investigators have used the data to address a variety of research and management objectives. In the USGS-BBS Home Page, results from the BBS are summarized and pictures of birds and other species are information. Data from 1966 - 2002 were managed by the SGS-LTER project.

Production of seeds of Bouteloua gracilis was evaluated for a semiarid grassland in northeastern Colorado. Ten locations were chosed to represent the range in soil textures and grazing intensities found at the Central Plains Experiemental Range research site. Number of flowering culms, inforescences and seeds, length of each flowering clum, total biomass or reproductive structures (culms, inforescences and seeds), and basal areas were assessed for each plant sampled. Community-level estimates of density of flowering culms and density of viable seeds are made for each location. Both soil texture and grazing intensity by cattle are important to spatial variability in seed production and other indicators of reproductive effort by B. gracilis.

CPER SOC across Toposequences - Pedons and their corresponding topography were described along an 8 km transect oriented normal to the major drainages of the CPER. A total of 140 pedons representing 23 toposequences and 7 plains segments were characterized. Sampling sites were selected within toposequences according to slope position (summit, shoulder, backslope, footslope, toeslope) and within plains segments at approximate 100 m intervals. Pedons were described and sampled by genetic horizon according to the standards of the National Cooperative Soil Survey. Analyses, conducted at Colorado State University, included particle size and organic C. Bulk density was estimated empirically according to: Rawls, W.J. 1983. Estimating soil bulk density form particle size analysis and organic matter content. Soil Sci 135: 123-125. Organic C accumulation was measured along an 8 km transect at a site in the semiarid shortgrass steppe of northeastern Colorado. Specific objectives of the study were to (I) measure the quantity and distribution of organic C across toposequences, (ii) test the hypothesis that a disproportionate amount of soil organic C resides in the lowlands (as defined herein), and (iii) assess the role of geomorphic history as a determinant of contemporary rates of biogeochemical organic C transformations. Results of the study showed the surface (A) horizon organic C concentration did not vary systematically among slope positions of a given toposequence. Similarly, the mass of organic C within the surface meter of soil often did not increase with decreasing elevation across a toposequence. Mass of organic C was found to range from 2.5 kg m^-3 on terrace escarpments to 10.7 kg m^-3 on sandy uplands. The mass of organic C, as calculated to the BCk horizon, was highest in the lowlands. The mass of buried organic C, as calculated uniformly for a 50 cm thickness of material, represents 17% of the total organic C estimate for the site. In spite of buried soils, lowlands did not contain a disproportionate amount of total landscape organic C.

SHOOTGRO,"<p>SHOOTGRO emphasizes the development and growth of the shoot apex of small-grain cereals such as winter and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). To better incorporate the variability typical in the field, up to six cohorts, or age classes, of plants are followed using a daily time step.</p>
<p>Assessing the influence of nitrogen and water availability on development and growth of individual organs of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is critical in evaluating the response of wheat to environmental conditions. We constructed a simulation model (SHOOTGRO 2.0) of shoot vegetative development and growth from planting to early boot by adding nitrogen and water balances and response functions for seedling emergence, tiller and leaf appearance, leaf and internode growth, and leaf and tiller senescence to the existing wheat development and growth model, SHOOTGRO 1.0. Model inputs include daily maximum and minimum air temperature, rainfall, daily photosynthetically active radiation, soil characteristics necessary to compute soil N and water balances, and several factors describing the cultivar and soil conditions at planting. The model provides information on development and growth characteristics of up to six cohorts of plants within the canopy (cohort groupings are based on time of emergence). The cohort structure allows SHOOTGRO 2.0 to provide output on the frequency of occurrence of plants with specific features (tillers and leaves) within the canopy. The model was constructed so that only water availability limited seedling emergence. Resource availability (nitrogen and water) does not influence time of leaf appearance. Leaf and internode growth, and leaf and tiller senescence processes are limited by the interaction of N and water availability. Tiller appearance is influenced by the correspondence to: W.W.

Predicted and observed dates of emergence and appearance of the first tiller had correlation coefficients of 0.98 and 0.93, respectively. However, these events were, on average, predicted 3.2 and 5.2 days later than observed. SHOOTGRO 2.0 generally under-predicted the number of culms per unit land area, partially because the simulation is limited to a maximum of 16 culms/plant. Model output shows that the simulation is sensitive to N and water inputs. The model provides a tool for predicting vegetative development and growth of the winter wheat with individual culms identified and followed from emergence through boot. SHOOTGRO 2.0 can be used in evaluating alternative crop management strategies.</p>

Venterea, Rodney T., Baker, John M., Dolan, Michael S., Spokas, Kurt A., Soil Science Society of America Journal; Madison. <a href=""http://search.proquest.com/assets/r20171.4.0.302.1590/core/spacer.gif70.5http://search.proquest.com/assets/r20171.4.0.302.1590/core/spacer.gif"">http://search.proquest.com/assets/r20171.4.0.302.1590/core/spacer.gif70....</a> (Sep/Oct 2006): 1752-1762.  Few studies have examined the impacts of rotational tillage regimes on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). We measured the C and N content of soils managed under corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) rotation following 10 and 15 yr of treatments. A conventional tillage (CT) regime employing moldboard and chisel plowing in alternate years was compared with both continuous no-till (NT) and biennial tillage (BT), which employed chisel plowing before soybean only. While masses of C and N in the upper 0.3 m under both BT and NT were higher than CT, only the BT treatment differed from CT when the entire sampled depth (0.6 m) was considered. Decreased C inputs, as indicated by reduced grain yields, may have limited C storage in the NT system. Thus, while more C was apparently retained under NT per unit of C input, some tillage appears necessary in this climate and cropping system to maximize C storage. Soil carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes under NT were greater than CT during a drier than normal year, suggesting that C storage may also be partly constrained under NT due to wetter conditions that promote increased soil respiration. Increased temperature sensitivity of soil respiration with increasing soil moisture was also observed. These findings indicate that long-term biennial chisel plowing for corn-soybean in the upper mid-west USA can enhance C storage, reduce tillage-related fuel costs, and maintain yields compared with more intensive annual tillage.

Quantifying N2O emissions from corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] fields under different fertilizer regimes is essential to developing national inventories of greenhouse gas emissions. The objective of this study was to compare N2O emissions in plots managed for more than 15 yr under continuous corn (C/C) vs. a corn-soybean (C/S) rotation that were fertilized during the corn phase with either anhydrous NH 3 (AA) or urea (U). During three growing seasons, N2O emissions from corn following corn were nearly identical to corn following soybean. In both systems, however, N2O emissions with AA were twice the emissions with U. After accounting for N2O emissions during the soybean phase, it was estimated that a shift from C/S to C/C would result in an increase in annual emissions of 0.78 kg N ha-1 (equivalent to 0.11 Mg CO2-C ha-1) when AA was used, compared with only 0.21 kg N ha-1 (0.03 Mg CO2-C ha-1) with U. In light of trends toward increased use of U, these results suggest that fertilizer-induced soil N2O emissions may decline in the future, at least per unit of applied N, although further study is needed in different soils and cropping systems. While soil CO2 emissions were 20% higher under C/C, crop residue from the prior year did not affect soil inorganic N or dissolved organic C during the subsequent season. We also compared different flux-calculation schemes, including a new method for correcting chamber-induced errors, and found that selection of a calculation method altered N2O emissions estimates by as much as 35%.</p>

SNAP - Soil Nutrient Assessment Program,"<p><a href=""https://snap.brc.tamus.edu/Home/Index"">SNAP (Soil Nutrient Assessment Program)</a>, a component of the <a href=""https://soilandwaterhub.brc.tamus.edu/Home/Index"">USDA/ARS Soil and Water Hub</a>, is a web-based tool that provides an estimate of plant-available nutrients that the soil naturally provides.</p>
<p>Soil test fertilizer recommendations have long been predicated upon response curves generated from fertility trials across the country. These response curves have been compared to relative yield which provide probability ranges for a response to varying fertilizer inputs. Category responses include very low, low, adequate, high or very high inversely related to probability of a response to various inputs of nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium (N, P, and K).</p>
<p>New soil test methods, increases in computing power and access to the internet have enabled development of an interactive tool that is based on plant available NPK from both the inorganic fraction and organic pool of the soil. The new methods provide an estimate of plant available nutrients that the soil naturally provides, which has largely been ignored for decades.</p>
<p>Since we have access to large datasets we can calculate the amounts of NPK required growing crops in lbs NPK per bu of the desired crop. For example, it requires 100 lbs of N, 50 lbs P2O5, 50 lbs K2O to grow 100 bu corn. These are the base numbers from which we subtract the soil test data after converting from the analytical ppm to Lbs P2O5 or lbs K2O. This is a straight subtraction. It also eliminates the need for ""calibration data"" since the soil tests reflect the soils inherent fertility. Using the example above, of 100, 50, 50 of N, P, and K required and soil test results of 25, 35, 45 then the fertilizer needed would be 75 N, 15 P2O5 and 5 K2O. This is a simple approach that doesn't get lost in relative yield-crop response curves that have been used for decades from differing geographical areas.</p>
<p>This tool will include current fertilizer prices, soil test inputs, and crop based county averages for the last 15 years that will predict the chances of making the yield goal the user inputs compared to historical yield data for their county and calculate the fertilizer cost with and without soil testing compared to user input yield goal and county average. This tool will allow the user via the internet to produce a more straightforward approach to realistically planning next year's fertilizer inputs and associated cost. It will also show the benefits of soil testing for increased fertilizer efficiency and reduced environmental impact.</p>

STARFM,"<p>Landsat 30m resolution observations provide sufficient spatial details for monitoring land surface and changes. However, the 16-day revisit cycle and cloud contamination have limited its use for studying global biophysical processes, which evolve rapidly during the growing season. Meanwhile, MODIS sensors aboard the NASA EOS Terra and Aqua satellites provide daily global observations valuable for capturing rapid surface changes. However, the spatial resolution of 250m to 1000m may not good enough for heterogeneous areas. To better utilize Landsat and MODIS data, the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) was developed (Gao et al., 2006). The STARFM algorithm uses spatial information from fine-resolution Landsat imagery and temporal information from coarse-resolution MODIS imagery to produce estimates of surface reflectance that are high resolution in both space and time. In essence, the collection of daily MODIS imagery and seasonal Landsat imagery allows the generation of synthetic daily Landsat-like views of the Earth’s surface.</p>
<p>The STARFM algorithm uses comparisons of one or more pairs of observed Landsat/MODIS maps, collected on the same day, to predict maps at Landsat-scale on other MODIS observation dates. STARFM was initially developed at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center by Dr. Feng Gao. This version (v1.2) has been greatly improved in computing efficiency (e.g. one run for multiple dates and parallel computing) for large-area processing (Gao et al., 2015). Additional improvements (e.g. Landsat and MODIS images co-registration, daily MODIS nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance) in the operational data fusion system (Wang et al., 2014) are beyond the STARFM program and are not included in this package. Improvement and continuous maintenance are being undertaken in the USDA-ARS Hydrology and Remote Sensing Laboratory (HRSL), Beltsville, MD by Dr. Feng Gao.</p>

SWAGMAN-Whatif,"<p>Effectively managing salt affected irrigated lands and judicially using irrigation water of marginal salinity quality requires understanding the interactions among many inputs. They include soil salinity, crop salt tolerances, soil physical properties, irrigation water quality, irrigation management, water table depth and quality, climatic factors and crop yield. Visualizing the simultaneous interactions among this many factors over a cropping season extends beyond the capacity of the human mind.</p>
<p>An interactive computer program was developed to simulate the interactions among the above factors. It shows how changing one factor impacts the outcome of the other factors for a single growing season. The user selects a climate, a crop, and soil characteristics from menu lists, and then sets the water table depth and quality, irrigation (river or well) water quality and then develops an irrigation schedule. On execution, the relative yield reductions due to over irrigation, under irrigation, and salinity, water table rise or fall and surface runoff are shown numerically for the growing season. Soil water content, soil salinity, water table depth changes and rain and irrigation events during the season are also shown graphically.</p>
<p>This is an educational tool designed to teach the concepts of salinity and irrigation management and IS NOT an irrigation scheduling program nor a management tool. Two versions have been developed, one using metric units, southern hemisphere growing seasons and Australian terminology, and a second using northern hemisphere growing seasons, with units and terminology currently used in US irrigated agriculture. An option in the US version also allows use of metric units.</p>

SWMS-2D,"<p>SWMS_2D is a computer program for simulating water and solute movement in two-dimensional variably saturated media. The program numerically solves the Richards' equation for saturated-unsaturated water flow and the convection-dispersion equation for solute transport. The flow equation incorporates a sink term to account for water uptake by plant roots. The transport equation includes provisions for linear equilibrium adsorption, zero-order production, and first-order degradation. The program may be used to analyze water and solute movement in unsaturated, partially saturated, or fully saturated porous media.</p>
<p>SWMS_2D can handle flow regions delineated by irregular boundaries. The flow region itself may be composed of nonuniform soils having an arbitrary degree of local anisotropy. Flow and transport can occur in the vertical plane, the horizontal plane, or in a three-dimensional region exhibiting radial symmetry about the vertical axis. The water flow part of the model can deal with prescribed head and flux boundaries, as well as boundaries controlled by atmospheric conditions.</p>
<p>New features of the present version 1.21 include the implementation of free drainage boundary conditions, and a simplified representation of nodal drains using results of electric analog experiments.</p>
<p>The governing flow and transport equations are solved numerically using Galerkin-type linear finite element schemes.

ScaleNet: Scale Insects (Coccoidea) Database,"<p>This database aims to provide comprehensive information on the scale insects (Coccoidea) of the world, of which there are about about 7,800 species.</p>
<p>Scale insects vary dramatically in their appearance from very small organisms (1-2mm) that occur under wax covers (some look like oyster shells), to shiny pearl-like objects (about 5mm), to creatures covered with mealy wax. They spend most or all of their lives feeding on plants and are primarily important as plant pests in  greenhouses, backyards, and on fruit trees.<br />
Scale insects damage millions of dollars worth of food, ornamental, fiber and greenhouse crops each year. Until ScaleNet, information about the pests was buried in thousands of scientific journals and books, making it difficult for the average person to locate.</p>
<p>The Agricultural Research Service developed ScaleNet with colleagues in Israel and Canada.  It will allow anyone to locate every scale insect that experts over the centuries have found and named.</p>
<p>Through keyword searches and other queries, ScaleNet provides comprehensive information including the insects' biology, classification, naming history, distribution, plant hosts, economic importance, controls and scientific literature about them.</p>
<p>Currently, information can be retrieved for 49 families, namely Aclerdidae (grass scales), Albicoccidae, Arnoldidae, Asterolecaniidae (pit scales), Beesoniidae, Burmacoccidae, Callipappidae, Carayonemidae, Cerococcidae (ornate pit scales), Coccidae (soft scales), Coelostomidiidae, Conchaspididae (false armoured scales), Dactylopiidae (cochineal scales), Diaspididae (armoured scale insects), Electrococcidae, Eriococcidae (felt scales), Grimaldiellidae, Grohnidae, Halimococcidae, Hammanococcidae, Inkaidae, Jersicoccidae, Kermesidae (gall-like scales), Kerriidae (lac scales), Kukaspididae, Kuwaniidae, Labiococcidae, Lebanococcidae, Lecanodiaspididae (false pit scales), Lithuanicoccidae, Marchalinidae, Margarodidae (ground pearls), Matsucoccidae (bast scales), Micrococcidae, Monophlebidae, Ortheziidae (ensign scales), Pennygullaniidae, Phenacoleachiidae, Phoenicococcidae (date scales), Pityococcidae, Pseudococcidae (mealybugs), Putoidae, Rhizoecidae, Serafinidae, Steingeliidae, Stictococcidae, Stigmacoccidae, Weitschatidae, and Xylococcidae.</p>
<p>The Reference database of ScaleNet includes about 25,000 references, the majority of which have been published since Linnaeus (1758). However, it also contains several pre-Linnean publications that are relevant to the nomenclature and systematics of the Coccoidea.</p>

Gibson with major support from the United States-Israel Binational Agricultural Research and Development Fund. The original application was heavily used by insect scientists and insect identifiers for close to two decades. This version was built by Mayrolin García and Nate Hardy using open source software (Linux, SQLite, Django (a Python web framework), and Apache2). Its development is supported by a Specific Cooperative Research agreement between Gary Miller at the USDA Systematic Entomology Lab and Nate Hardy at Auburn University.

"Seasonal reference harvest measurements of vegetation at 15 net primary production (NPP) study sites at Jornada Basin LTER, 1989-ongoing","<p>This data package contains reference harvest measurements for the long-term Net Primary Production (NPP) study at the Jornada Basin LTER. Data here include horizontal cover, vertical height, and aboveground biomass of plants harvested near, but outside, a grid of permanent NPP quadrats at each of 15 NPP sites. These sites were selected to represent the 5 major ecosystem types in the Chihuahuan Desert (upland grasslands, playa grasslands, mesquite-dominated shrublands, creosotebush-dominated shrublands, tarbush-dominated shrublands). For each ecosystem type, three sites were selected to represent the range in variability in production and plant diversity; thus the locations are not replicates. At each site, a 1 hectare area was fenced in 1988 and a grid of 49 (48 at one playa location) 1m x 1m replicate quadrats was laid out when sampling began in 1989. Harvests are made outside the quadrat grid, but inside the fence. Height and cover are recorded in the field. Live biomass is weighed in the lab and all measurements are recorded as reference harvest data. Subsequently, regressions between the harvested biomass and plant volume values are used to derive allometric equations that determine biomass from non-destructive volume measurements in the permanent NPP quadrats. Further details are described in the methods metadata. This is an ongoing study with new harvest data (from selected species) collected in the spring, fall, and winter each year.Attention:These data are not appropriate for estimates of percentage cover because of the way the data are collected.</p>

SeedChaser - Version 2.0,"<p>Knowledge of the vertical distribution of surface residues, chemicals, or seeds following tillage operations is of paramount importance to a wide variety of soil research areas. SeedChaser is a 1-D empirical vertical soil tillage distribution model with 1 cm grid spacing that predicts vertical redistribution of weed seeds following user selected (a) sequences of tillage implements, and (b) initial seed distribution values. Results of this model are particularly suited for weed seed emergence modeling. However, the model can be adapted easily to any surface broadcasted agrochemical or incorporated residues. The present model can handle up to twenty passes of user selected sequences of sixteen different implements.</p>
<p>Majority of prior models examined only the impact of a more limited list of implements at much larger depth intervals, which reduced the predictability of fine-scale vertical movement that may be needed for simulating movements of seeds or chemical granules. SeedChaser consolidates the results from these previous models along with new data on conservation tillage implements into a prediction tool that would have applications both in weed science, as well as other soil research areas.</p>

"Shortgrass Steppe for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Nunn, Colorado","<p>Shortgrass Steppe for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Nunn, Colorado<br />
Cattle play a major role in nutrient cycling of grassland ecosystems through biomass removal and excrement deposition (urine and feces).  We studied the effects of cattle excrement patches (urine at 430 and feces at 940 kg N ha-1) on nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes using semi-static chambers on cool-season (C3), Bozoisky-select (*Psathyrostachys juncea*) pasture, and warm-season (C4)-dominated native rangeland of the shortgrass steppe (SGS) in northeastern Colorado.  Nitrous oxide emission factors (EF; i.e., percent of added N emitted as N2O-N) did not differ between urine and feces on the C4-dominated native rangeland (0.11 and 0.10%) and C3 pasture (0.13 and 0.10%).  These EFs are substantially less than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1 Default EF (2%) for manure deposited on pasture, indicating that during dry years the IPCC Tier 1 Default EF would result in a significant overestimation of emissions from excrement patches deposited on SGS C4-dominated native rangeland and C3 pasture.  Over the first year of the study (19 June 2012 to 18 June 2013), cumulative CH4 uptake was 38% greater for urine (-1.49 vs. -1.08 kg CH4-C ha-1) and 28% greater for control plots (-2.09 vs. -1.63 kg CH4-C ha-1) on C4-dominated native rangeland compared to C3 pasture.  In contrast, feces patches were net sources of CH4 with emissions from the C3 pasture (0.64 kg CH4-C ha-1) 113% greater than the C4-dominated native rangeland (0.30 kg CH4-C ha-1).  Conversion of C4-dominated native rangeland to C3 pasture can have short and long term effects on CH4 uptake; therefore consideration should be taken before implementing this management practice.</p>

Small Watershed Hydrology (WinTR-55),"<p>WinTR-55 is a single-event rainfall-runoff small watershed hydrologic model.  The model generates hydrographs from both urban and agricultural areas and at selected points along the stream system. Hydrographs are routed downstream through channels and/or reservoirs. Multiple sub-areas can be modeled within the watershed.</p>
<p>Historical Background</p>
<p>Technical Release 55 (TR-55) Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds was first issued in January 1975 as a simplified procedure to calculate the storm runoff volume, peak rate of discharge, hydrographs and storage volumes required for storm water management structures (SCS, 1975). The first issue involved manual methods and assumed the NRCS Type II rainfall distribution for all calculations.</p>
<p>In June 1986 major revisions were made in TR-55 by adding three rainfall distributions (Type I, IA and III) and programming the computations.  Time of concentration was estimated by splitting the hydraulic flow path into separate flow phases (SCS, 1986).  The computer program became a standard tool to analyze peak flow changes caused by urbanization in many locations.  Its wide acceptance by public and private users has also indicated where improvements could be made in the procedures and the computer program.</p>
<p>A WinTR-55 work group was formed in the spring of 1998 to modernize and revise the Technical Release and the computer software.  The current changes include: upgrade the source code to Visual Basic, change the philosophy of data input, develop a Windows interface and output post- processor, enhance the hydrograph-generation capability of the software and flood route hydrographs through stream reaches and reservoirs.</p>
<p>The availability and technical capabilities of the personal computer have significantly changed the philosophy of problem-solving for the engineer. Computer availability eliminated the need for WinTR-55 Guide methods, thus the guide portions (graphs and tables) of the user document have been eliminated. This user guide covers the procedures used in and the operation of the WinTR-55 computer program.  Part 630 of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) National Engineering Handbook provides detailed information on NRCS hydrology and is the technical reference for this document.  Appendix C of the WinTR-55 User Guide (part of the install package) contains a list of the Part 630 chapters and their subjects.  Users who are not familiar with NRCS hydrologic procedures should refer to the appropriate chapters for background information and the details of procedural techniques.</p>

Snowmelt Runoff Model for Windows (WinSRM),"<p>The Snowmelt-Runoff Model (WinSRM) is designed to simulate and forecast daily streamflow in mountain basins where snowmelt is a major runoff factor. The Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM) is a simple degree-day model that requires remote sensing input in the form of basin or zonal snow cover extent. The model has been tested successfully on over 60 basins worldwide in the simulation and forecast modes. Model variables are derived from actual observations of temperature, precipitation, and snow covered area. Model parameters can either be derived from measurements or estimated by hydrological judgement taking into account the basin characteristics, physical laws, and theoretical or empirical relationships. To facilitate use of SRM, a microcomputer version of the program has been developed for IBM compatible personal computers. The program itself features user-oriented input and multiple self-help screens which allow the user to select the kind of data input employed and the output products desired.</p>

"Soil Dynamics Research for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Auburn, Alabama","<p>Soil Dynamics Research for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in Auburn, Alabama<br />
This study provides data on soil C and N dynamics and subsequent trace gas emissions at the landscape scale. Evaluates effects of landscape and soil management on 1) methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes, 2) soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization and 3) cover crop decomposition and mineralization. Gas fluxes, C and N mineralization, and cover crop decomposition were determined on a 9-ha field at the E.V. Smith Research Center near Shorter, in AL. Consists of six replications of agroecosystem management [(corn (Zea mays L.)-cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L). rotation] that traverse the landscape. Soil managements included CsT, conventional tillage (CT), conservation tillage with dairy manure (CsTM), and conventional tillage with dairy manure (CTM) treatments. The soil management treatments were within summit, sideslope and the drainageway landscape positions. The drainageway landscape position emitted 46, 251, 59, and 185 mg CH4-C ha-1 h-1 from CT, CTM, CsT and CsTM treatments, respectively. The summit position was a CH4 consumer with CT and CsT treatments. Significant soil management treatment differences in N2O-N flux were observed only within the drainageway landscape position. Averaged across seasons, CT and CsT emitted similar N2O-N in the drainageway. Within the drainageway, dairy manure decreased N2O-N emission on CT treatments. Carbon dioxide emission in winter 2005 from CsT treatments (averaged across landscape positions) was 1304 g ha-1 h-1 CO2-C compared to 227 g ha-1 h-1 CO2-C from CT treatments. CsT and CsTM treatments increased soil organic C and total soil N after six years. This resulted in higher C and N mineralization on soils from CsT and CsTM treatments, with no differences between landscape positions. Potential C mineralization was similar for crimson clover, spring forage rape and white lupin amended soil while black oat amended soil immobilized N. Buried cover crops decomposed and mineralized faster than surface applied materials, with no differences in cover crop decomposition and mineralization k across landscape positions. Overall, landscape variability had minimal effect on C and N dynamics and cover crop decomposition compared to soil management effects. Conservation tillage, dairy manure applications, and cover crops showed potential to sequester soil organic C and increase total soil N in these systems.The study site is located at the Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station’s E.V. Smith Research Center, near Shorter. Four management treatments were established in late summer of2000 on a corn and cotton rotation that has both crops present each year. The management systems included a conventional tillage system (chisel- followed by disc-plow) with (CT+M) and without (CT) manure, and a conservation tillage system (non- inversion tillage) that incorporated the use of winter cover crops with (NT+M) and without manure (NT). A mixture of rye (Secale cereale L.) with black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb.), and a mixture of crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.) with white lupin (Lupinus albus L.) and fodder radish (Raphanus sativus L.) were typically used as winter cover before cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and corn (Zea mays L.), respectively. Four strips with an average length of 800 ft were established across the landscape to represent the four management systems for each crop per each replication. Each strip was further divided into cells to simplify sampling and field measurements. A total of six replications were established on the 22 ac field. Maximum slope is 8% and 9 soil map units are contained within this landscape. Prior research work at the same field site delineated four distinct zones using a digital elevation map, electrical conductivity survey, and traditional soil mapping techniques. For this study, three of these zones were selected and recognized as summit, backslope, and accumulation zones in the landscape. Two cells per management and zone were selected to conduct soil physical properties characterization (Fig. 1). Soil properties studied included total soil C by dry combustion at three depths, water infiltration with a mini-disk infiltrometer (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA)1, and water stable aggregates (Nimmo and Perkings, 2002). Data were analyzed with the MIXED model procedure in SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Management system, landscape position, depth, and their interactions were considered as fixed effects.</p>

<p>This dataset contains soil water content data developed from neutron probe readings taken in access tubes in each of the four large, precision weighing lysimeters and in the fields surrounding each lysimeter at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU), Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL) beginning in 1989. Readings were taken periodically with a field-calibrated neutron probe at depths from 10 cm to 230 cm (maximum of 190 cm depth in the lysimeters) in 20-cm depth increments. Periods between readings were typically one to two weeks, sometimes longer according to experimental design and need for data. Field calibrations in the Pullman soil series were done every few years. Calibrations typically produced a regression equation with RMSE &lt;= 0.01 m3 m-3 (e.g., Evett and Steiner, 1995). Data were used to guide irrigation scheduling to achieve full or deficit irrigation as required by the experimental design. Data may be used to calculate the soil profile water content in mm of water from the surface to the maximum depth of reading. Profile water content differences between reading times in the same access tube are considered the change in soil water storage during the period in question and may be used to compute evapotranspiration (ET) using the soil water balance equation: ET = (change in storage + P + I + F + R, where P is precipitation during the period, I is irrigation during the period, F is soil water flux (drainage) out of the bottom of the soil profile during the period, and R is the sum of runon and runoff during the period. Typically, R is taken as zero because the fields were furrow diked to prevent runon and runoff during most of each growing season.</p>

Study sites were established in 1995; one in black grama grassland and the other in creosotebush shrubland to compare the impact of herbivores on ecosystem processes between these vegetation types. Parallel studies were established at the Sevilleta LTER site (New Mexico, USA) and Mapimi Biosphere Reserve (Durango, Mexico). Each study site is 1 km by 0.5 km in area. Four replicate experimental blocks were randomly located at the grassland study site to measure vegetation responses using exclusion treatments including a) all mammalian herbivores, including cattle, lagomorphs, and rodents, b) lagomorphs and cattle only, c) cattle only, and d) control accessible to all herbivores. Because grazing cattle are excluded from the entire creosote site, only three replicate experimental blocks were randomly located there including a) all mammalian herbivores, including lagomorphs, and rodents, b) lagomorphs only, and c) control accessible to all herbivores. Thirty-six sampling points were positioned at 5.8-meter intervals on a systematically located 6 by 6 point grid within each plot. A permanent one-meter by one-meter vegetation measurement quadrat is located at each of the 36 points.

"Soil movement across black grama and mesquite ecotone transects in the Jornada Basin, southern New Mexico, USA, 1933-2011","<p>This package contains data from a study that measured long-term soil movement in areas undergoing mesquite invasion on the Jornada Experimental Range from 1933-2011. Data consist of height measurements of soil on two long-term transects established in the Natural Revegetation Exclosure (NatReveg) in 1933 and an exclosure in Pasture 8b in 1935. In 1933, about half of the NatReveg exclosure was covered with mesquite dunes. Grasses dominated the non-dune portion, but mesquite plants were present. Approximately one-third of the NatReveg site exclosure was sprayed with 2,4,5-T herbicide for mesquite control in 1966-68. Additional herbicide treatments were conducted upon the sprayed portion in 1969-72. The 1731-m NatReveg exclosure transect runs north-south through the center of the exclosure and extends 61 m (200ft) beyond the boundary fence on either end. The 457-m Pasture 8b transect is oriented WSW-ENE and was established in an area where mesquite dunes were large and well established. The predominant soils in this exclosure are deep loamy sands. Soil movement was measured by the distance between the soil surface and a notch in 50 cm T-posts located every 15.2 m (50 ft). Transects were measured in 1950 (8b only), 1955 (8b only), every five years from 1980-2000, and most recently in 2011. Most steel posts were re-measured at these intervals, but some were lost due to excavation or burial. These were replaced with a new baseline notch height initiated on the posts. Data correspond to each year of collection, as well as measures (in cm) of soil deposition or deflation during the intervals. This study is complete.For further information, see:Gibbens, R.P., J.M.

Soils Data for North Dakota Mined Land Reclamation Experiments in the 1970’s Using Soil Respreading,"<p>In the early 1970’s, it was determined that the most feasible way to reclaim lands disturbed by coal surface mining in the Northern Great Plains region was through the respreading of salvaged soil.  In 1974, scientists at the Northern Great Plains Research Laboratory of the Agricultural Research Service -- U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA-ARS) initiated two experiments designed to determine the thicknesses of respread soil necessary to restore productivity to difficult-to-reclaim sodic minespoils in central North Dakota (ND).  In both experiments, motorscraper and other earthmoving equipment was used to construct wedge-shaped masses of subsoil materials over leveled minespoils and then to cover these with uniform thicknesses of topsoil material.  Topsoil consisted of predominately A horizon material from Haplustoll soils, and subsoil consisted of B and C horizon material.</p>
<p>In one experiment near the town of Stanton ND, a subsoil wedge was constructed on leveled minespoil and consisted of 12 long contiguous blocks of material (which were the main plots), three replications of four topsoil thickness treatments.  For each replication, three of the main treatment blocks consisted of subsoil material, and one was a 3:1 subsoil – topsoil mix.  The topsoil treatments consisted of no topsoil, 20 cm, 60 cm, and no topsoil on the mixed soil block.  Each main treatment block was split into four long strips and seeded to crops of alfalfa, crested wheatgrass, spring wheat, and warm-season grass mix.  The wedge was 240 m long, 65 m wide, and 2.1 m high at the summit.</p>
<p>In another experiment near the town of Zap ND, a double subsoil wedge was constructed on leveled minespoil and consisted of six long contiguous blocks of material (which were the main plots), two replications on each side of the wedge, for a total of four replications with three subsoil quality treatments.  The subsoils varied in soil texture, salinity and sodicity.  The wedge was covered with a uniform 20 cm thickness of topsoil.  Each main treatment block was split into four long strips and seeded to the same crops as the Stanton site with the exception of warm-season grass mix, which was replaced with Russian wildrye.  The double wedge was 124 m long, and about 50 m from each toe to summit for a total width of 102 m and was 2.1 m high at the summit.</p>

SolarCalQ - Version 1,"<p>SolarCalQ • Version 1.0 - Java model to simulate spectral quality at any location on the globe.</p>
<p>The purpose of this JAVA model is to simulate the spectral quality of incident solar radiation for any location on the globe, down to one minute time steps. This JAVA model is an adaptation of existing NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) solar spectral quality (Bird and Riordan 1984, 1986) and solar position models (Reda and Andreas, 2003), with significant modifications that are outlined below. The solar position model of Reda and Andreas (2003) has been shown to be accurate within the time period from the year -2000 to 6000, with uncertainties of +/- 0.0003 degrees in the solar zenith and azimuth angles based on the date, time, and location on the Earth. Additional modifications that were added into the SolarCalQ model are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simulation of daily maximum and minimum temperatures (from Global TempSIM),</li>
<li>Minutely temperature estimates were extracted utilizing the algorithms of Cesaraccio et al. (2001),</li>
<li>Original SolarCalc (Spokas and Forcella, 2006) model to produce an improved prediction in the overall intensity of the solar radiation,</li>
<li>Zip Code Search to allow easier user input of latitude and longitude in the U.S.</li>
<li>Empirical model for total precipitable water vapor based upon Liebe (1989) model for estimating percipitable water from surface relative humidity and surface temperatures (both of these are estimated from Global TempSIM), and</li>
<li>Empirical models for ozone concentration and atmospheric optical depth (or aerosol optical depth) predictions.</li>
</ol>
<p>The atmospheric optical depth has been linked to 3 components: Clear sky + clouds + aerosols</p>
<p>Spectral intensity is predicted either in integrated units (W m-2) or raw intensity units (W m-2um-1). The wavelength spacing is irregular, covering 122 wavelengths from 305 nm to 4000 nm.</p>
<p>User Input:</p>
<p>User input is handled through tabbed entry windows. An example of one of these windows is shown below. There are help screens included in the program to guide the user through the necessary input parameters.</p>

SolarCalc 1.0,"<p>Solar Calc: Estimating Hourly Incoming Solar Radiation from Limited Meteorological Data</p>
<p>Two major properties which determine weed seed germination are soil temperature and moisture content. Incident radiation is the primary variable controlling energy input to the soil system and thereby influences both moisture and temperature profiles. However, a majority of agricultural field sites lack proper instrumentation to measure solar radiation directly. To overcome this shortcoming, an empirical model was developed to estimate total incident solar radiation (beam and diffuse) with hourly time steps.</p>
<p>Input parameters for the model are latitude, longitude, and elevation of the field site, along with daily precipitation (mm) with daily minimum and maximum air temperatures (degrees C). The file format for this weather data file is a comma spaced value file (CSV) with the following format:</p>
<p>DOY, MIN, MAX, PREC</p>
<p>Where DOY is day of year, MIN is the minimum air temperature, MAX is the maximum air temperature, and PREC is the total daily rainfall. Each day has a separate line in the file. Field validation of this model was conducted at a total of 18 sites, where sufficient meteorological data were available for validation, allowing a total of 42 individual yearly comparisons.</p>
<p>The model performed well, with an average Pearson correlation of 0.92, d-index of 0.95, modeling efficiency of 0.80, root mean square error of 111 W m-2, and a mean absolute error of 56 W m-2. These results compare favorably to other developed empirical solar radiation models, but with the advantage of predicting hourly solar radiation for the entire year based on limited climatic data and no site-specific calibration requirement. This solar radiation prediction tool can be integrated into dormancy, germination and growth models to improve microclimate-based simulation of development of weeds and other plants.</p>

Sorption Isotherm Spreadsheet,"<p>Spreadsheet from the paper entitled: On the Use of Linearized Langmuir Equations by C.H. Bolster and G.M. Hornberger, Soil Science Society of America Journal, 2007, 71(6): 1796-1806.</p>
<p>Spreadsheet has been modified to correct the following errors:</p>
<p>(11/01/12)</p>
<p>In earlier versions the initial guess for the n parameter in the Freundlich model did not update when data were added to spreadsheet. This has now been corrected in the new vesrion (1.6)</p>
<p>(3/17/10)</p>
<ol>
<li>In the original spreadsheet the L-F model (Eq. [2]) did not have the K value raised to the n power. The attached spreadsheet has corrected this.</li>
<li>There was a typo in the units with the Langmuir K parameter in the spreadsheet. The units should have read L/mg rather than L/kg when C is in mg/L. To avoid confusion, in the updated version the units have been removed since they are dependent on the units used for C and S.</li>
<li>I have recently shown that the traditional method of weighting data by the inverse of the variance in the dependent variable can lead to poorer parameter estimates and uncertainties than with unweighted least squares regression when applied to sorption data (C.H. Bolster and J. Tellinghuisen. 2010. On the Significance of Properly Weighting Sorption Data for Least-Squares Analysis. Soil Science Society of America 74:670-679). Therefore, the weighting option has been removed from the spreadsheet (3/2010).

Southern Great Plains 1997 (SGP97) Hydrology: United States Geological Survey (USGS) Daily Reservoir Data,"<p>The United States Geological Survey (USGS) Reservoir dataset is one of various hydrological datasets provided for the Southern Great Plains 1997 (SGP97) project. This dataset contains reservoir data from stations in SGP97 domain. The data collected at USGS gaging stations consist of records of stage and measurements of discharge of streams or canals, and stage, surface area, and contents of lakes or reservoirs. This dataset contains only the USGS reservoir data. For a lake or reservoir, capacity tables giving the contents for any stage are prepared from stage-area relation curves defined by surveys. The application of the stage to the capacity table gives the contents, from which the daily, monthly, or yearly change in contents is computed. If the stage-capacity curve is subject to changes because of deposition of sediment in the reservoir, periodic resurveys of the reservoir are necessary to define new stage-capacity curves.  During the period between reservoir surveys, the computed contents may be increasingly in error due to the gradual accumulation of sediments. For some gaging stations there are periods when no gage-height record is obtained or the recorded gage height is so faulty that it cannot be used to compute daily discharge or contents. This happens when the recorder stops or otherwise fails to operate properly, intakes are plugged, the float is frozen in the well, or for various other reasons. For such periods, the daily contents may be estimated on the basis of operator's log, prior and subsequent records, inflow-outflow studies, and other information. The USGS reservoir data are provided in a single file and are provided ""as is"" in their original card image format. There are six different types of ""cards images"" which appear in the USGS reservoir dataset. Each card has a unique format, but the first character of a card image always indicates the card type. Depending upon the card type, the card image may contain metadata and/or data. No additional quality control was performed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research/Joint Office for Science Support (UCAR/JOSS).</p>

Southern Great Plains 1997 (SGP97) Hydrology: United States Geological Survey (USGS) Stream Flow Data,"<p>The United States Geological Survey (USGS) stream flow dataset is one of various datasets provided for the Southern Great Plains 1997 (SGP97) project. This dataset contains stream flow data from 997 USGS stations in the SGP97 domain. The data collected at USGS gaging stations consist of records of stage and measurements of discharge of streams or canals, and stage, surface area, and contents of lakes or reservoirs. This dataset contains only the USGS stream flow data. For USGS stream-gaging stations, the daily mean discharge is computed from gage heights and rating tables. These rating tables are prepared from stage-discharge-relation curves and give the discharge for any stage. If the stage-discharge relation for a station is temporarily changed by the presence of aquatic growth or debris on the control, the daily mean discharge is computed by what is basically the shifting-control method. At some USGS gaging stations, acoustic velocity meter (AVM) systems are used to compute discharge. The AVM system measures the stream's velocity at one or more paths in the cross section. Coefficients are developed to relate this path velocity to the mean velocity in the cross section. Cross-sectional area curves are developed to relate stage to cross section area. Discharge is computed by multiplying path velocity by the appropriate stage related coefficient and area. Changing stage, backwater from reservoirs, tributary streams, or other sources, and ice in the winter affect the stage-discharge relation. Special methods, such as using comparable records of discharge for other stations, are then used to compute discharge. If no gage-height record can be obtained from a gaging station due to failed equipment, etc., daily discharge values are estimated using various means. The USGS stream flow dataset contains three metadata parameters and three data parameters. The metadata parameters identify the network, station, and time at which the data was collected. Each record contains one month's data. The three data parameters (stream flow, stage, and hour of observation) are repeated once for each UTC day (0000 to 2300). All records contain data for 31 days regardless of the actual number of days in a month. Months with less than 31 days are padded with missing values (e.g., -999.99). The stream flow values are reported in cubic meters per second and are 24 hour averages. There are no stage values in this dataset, so the stage values are shown as missing. The hour of observation is the beginning UTC hour for the 24 hour period for which the stream flow value is valid. No additional quality control was performed by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research/Joint Office for Science Support (JOSS).</p>

The full Eta MOLTS dataset covers most of North America east of the Rocky Mountains (up to 574 locations). MOLTS are hourly time series output at selected locations that contain values for various surface parameters and ‘sounding’ profiles at Eta model levels, and are derived from the Eta model output. The MOLTS output files were converted into Joint Office for Science Support (JOSS) Quality Control Format (QCF), the same format used for atmospheric rawinsonde soundings processed by JOSS. The MOLTS output provided by JOSS on-line includes only the initial analysis output (i.e. no forecast MOLTS) and only state parameters (pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind). The full output, including the forecast MOLTS and all output parameters, in its original format (Binary Universal Form for the Representation of meteorological data, or BUFR) is available from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)/Scientific Computing Division. The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) began operations for the Eta model in June 1993 with a resolution of 80 km and 38 levels; the top level was 50 mb. In late 1994, the domain of the Eta model was increased and the resolution became 48 km with 38 levels. The Eta analysis and forecast fields are generated every 12 hours at 0000 and 1200 UTC daily. MOLTS are hourly vertical profile and surface time series derived from the Eta model output. The complete MOLTS output includes a changable number of informational items, parameters for each level, and parameters at the surface. Output are available each hour beginning at the initial analysis (the only output available from JOSS) and ending at the 48 hour forecast. JOSS converts the raw format files into JOSS QCF format which is the same format used for atmospheric sounding data such as National Weather Service (NWS) soundings. JOSS calculated the total wind speed and direction from the u and v wind components. JOSS calculated the mixing ratio from the specific humidity (Pruppacher and Klett 1980) and the dew point from the mixing ratio (Wallace and Hobbs 1977). Then the relative humidity was calculated from the dew point (Bolton 1980). The altitude was not one of the available output parameters from the Eta MOLTS. JOSS did not conduct any quality control on this output. The header records (15 total records) contain output type, project ID, the location of the nearest station to the MOLTS location (this can be a rawinsonde station, an Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM)/Cloud and Radiation Testbed (CART) station, a wind profiler station, a surface station, or just the nearest town), the location of the MOLTS output, and the valid time for the MOLTS output. The five header lines contain information identifying the sounding, and have a rigidly defined form. The following 6 header lines are used for auxiliary information and comments about the sounding, and they vary significantly from dataset to dataset.

SoyBase and the Soybean Breeder's Toolbox,"<p>SoyBase is a repository for genetics, genomics and related data resources for soybean. It contains current genetic, physical and genomic sequence maps integrated with qualitative and quantitative traits.</p>
<p>SoyBase database was established in the 1990s as the USDA Soybean Genetics Database. Originally, it contained only genetic information about soybeans such as genetic maps and information about the Mendelian genetics of soybean. In time SoyBase was expanded to include molecular data regarding soybean genes and sequences as they became available. In 2010, the soybean genome sequence was published and it and supporting gene sequences have been integrated into the SoyBase sequence browser. SoyBase genetic maps were used in the assembly of both the Williams 82 2010 assembly (Wm82.a1.v1) and the newest genome assembly (Wm82.a2.v1).</p>
<p>SoyBase also incorporates information about mutant and other soybean genetic stocks and serves as a contact point for ordering strains from those populations. As association analyses continue due to various re-sequencing efforts SoyBase will also incorporate those data into the soybean genome browser as they become available. Gene expression patterns are also available at SoyBase through the SoyBase expression pages and the Soybean Gene Atlas. Other expression/transcriptome/methylomic data sets also have been and continue to be incorporated into the SoyBase genome browser.</p>

Soybean Aphids per Plant Among Soybean Lines Containing Various Rag Genes,"<p>The soybean aphid (<em>Aphis glycines</em>) is an insect pest of cultivated soybeans (<em>Glycine max</em>). Several genes with resistance to <em>A. glycines</em> (i.e. <em>Rag</em> genes) have been identified in soybean.  Virulent strains of soybean aphid are able to overcome the resistance and colonize soybeans having one or more <em>Rag</em> genes. It is important to classify virulent strains of soybean aphids in evaluating soybean lines in order to develop cultivars with durable resistance. The files presented here report the number of soybean aphids on soybean lines that differed in the <em>Rag</em> genes they contained. Two colonies of soybean aphid were tested.</p>
<p>Materials and Methods</p>
<p>Tests were conducted separately against the two soybean aphid colonies, which were maintained on soybean plants at North Central Agricultural Research Laboratory (NCARL), USDA-ARS, Brookings, South Dakota, USA, largely according to procedures described in Hesler and Tilmon (2018). The first colony was established from a single aphid collected near Volga, South Dakota, USA in 2016 and designated as ‘Volga16’ (Conzemius et al. 2019). It was reared on soybean cultivar ‘LD12R12-15805Ra’ (<em>Rag1</em>+<em>Rag2</em> pyramid; University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA).</p>
<p>A second colony designated ‘Accrue’ was derived from a colony originally established from a single first instar isolated from aphids collected at Urbana, IL, USA, and initially reared in Urbana (‘Urbana clone’; Hill et al. 2004). This colony was established as an avirulent soybean aphid colony (Hill et al. 2004). A series of sequential colonies from the initial colony was established, in order, at The Ohio State University, Wooster, OH, USA; Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA; South Dakota State University, Brookings, SD, USA; and finally, in 2018 at NCARL. Although established as an ostensibly avirulent colony derived from the ‘Urbana clone’ colony, it was unexpectedly virulent against a known resistant accession, LD05R-16137 (containing <em>Rag1</em>), in initial screening tests.</p>
<p>Two separate no-choice tests were run for each soybean aphid colony. Each test consisted of seven soybean lines. Six had one or more <em>Rag</em> genes: 19APH18 (<em>Rag1</em>), 19APH25 (<em>Rag2</em>), 19INC (<em>Rag3</em>), 19APH29 (<em>Rag4</em>), 19APH30 (<em>Rag6</em>), 19APH09Rag12 (a <em>Rag1</em>+<em>Rag2</em> pyramid); and ‘Titan,’ an aphid-susceptible soybean cultivar (Diers et al. 1999). Two-week-old, unifoliate-stage soybean plants growing in plastic pots (6 cm top diameter, 4 cm bottom diameter, 5.7 cm height) were each infested with 10 apterous adult soybean aphids and covered with a clear plastic, ventilated, cylindrical tube. After 20 days in an environmental chamber, the shoots of test plants were clipped at soil level, placed individually in sealable plastic bags, and stored in a freezer. Plants were removed over the next few days, and the aphids on them were counted.<br />
The data are contained in separate files—one for each of two soybean aphid colonies.</p>

"Standard Quality Controlled Research Weather Data – USDA-ARS, Bushland, Texas","<p>[ NOTE – 2022/05/06: this dataset supersedes the earlier versions <a href=""https://doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1482548"">https://doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1482548</a> and <a href=""https://doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1526329"">https://doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC/1526329</a> ].</p>
<p>This dataset contains 15-minute mean weather data from the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU) research weather station, Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL) for all days in each year. The data are from sensors placed at 2-m height over a level, grass surface mowed to not exceed 12 cm height and irrigated and fertilized to maintain reference conditions as promulgated by Allen et al. (2005, 1998). Irrigation was by surface flood in 1989 through 1994, and by subsurface drip irrigation after 1994. Sensors were replicated and intercompared between replicates and with data from nearby weather stations, which were sometimes used for gap filling. Quality control and assurance methods are described by Evett et al. (2018). Data from a duplicate sensor were used to fill gaps in data from the primary sensor using appropriate regression relationships. Gap filling was also accomplished using sensors deployed at one of the four large weighing lysimeters immediately west of the weather station, or using sensors at other nearby stations when reliable regression relationships could be developed. The primary paper describes details of the sensors used and methods of testing, calibration, inter-comparison, and use. The weather data include air temperature (C) and relative humidity (%), wind speed (m/s), solar irradiance (W m-2), barometric pressure (kPa), and precipitation (rain and snow in mm). Because the large (3 m by 3 m surface area) weighing lysimeters are better rain gages than are tipping bucket gages, the 15-minute precipitation data are derived for each lysimeter from changes in lysimeter mass. The land slope is &lt;0.3% and flat. The mean annual precipitation is ~470 mm, the 20-year pan evaporation record indicates ~2,600 mm Class A pan evaporation per year, and winds are typically from the South and Southwest. The climate is semi-arid with ~70% (350 mm) of the annual precipitation occurring from May to September, during which period the pan evaporation averages ~1520 mm.<br />
These datasets originate from research aimed at determining crop water use (ET), crop coefficients for use in ET-based irrigation scheduling based on a reference ET, crop growth, yield, harvest index, and crop water productivity as affected by irrigation method, timing, amount (full or some degree of deficit), agronomic practices, cultivar, and weather. The data have utility for testing simulation models of crop ET, growth, and yield and have been used by the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP), by OPENET, and by many others for testing, and calibrating models of ET that use satellite and/or weather data.</p>

<p>This dataset consists of weather data for each year when maize was grown for grain at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU) research weather station, Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). Maize was grown for grain on four large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. The four square fields are themselves arranged in a larger square with the fields in four adjacent quadrants of the larger square. Fields and lysimeters within each field are thus designated northeast (NE), southeast (SE), northwest (NW), and southwest (SW). Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system in 1989, 1990, and 1994. In 2013, 2016, and 2018, two lysimeters and their respective fields (NE and SE) were irrigated using subsurface drip irrigation (SDI), and two lysimeters and their respective fields (NW and SW) were irrigated by a linear move sprinkler system. Irrigations were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe to 2.4-m depth in the field.<br />
    The weather data include solar irradiance, barometric pressure, air temperature and relative humidity, and wind speed determined using sensors placed at 2-m height over a level, grass surface mowed to not exceed 12 cm height and irrigated and fertilized to maintain reference conditions as promulgated by ASCE (2005) and FAO (1996). Irrigation was by surface flood in 1989 through 1994, and by subsurface drip irrigation after 1994. Sensors were replicated and intercompared between replicates and with data from nearby weather stations, which were sometimes used for gap filling. Quality control and assurance methods are described by Evett et al. (2018).<br />

"Stream water concentrations of herbicides and nutrients for sites in the northern Missouri and southern Iowa region, 1994 to 1999","<p>The data set contains stream water concentrations of herbicides and nutrients for 153 sites in the northern Missouri/southern Iowa region from 1994 to 1995. The data are available in Microsoft Excel 2010 format. Sheet 1 (Metadata) of the file contains supporting information regarding the length of record, site locations, parameters measured, concentrations units, method detection limits, describes the meaning of zero and blank cells, defines the major land resource areas (MLRAs) of the region, and provides a link to the U. S. Geological Survey discharge data. Sheet 2 (Site names and locations) has a list of the site names by MLRA, river system, and site name. It also contains site locations, provided as Universal Transverse Mercator coordinates, drainage areas, and indicates which sites were co-located at U. S. Geological Survey gauge sites. Sheet 3 (Concentration Data) contains data for 15 herbicide and nutrient analytes along with the corresponding site name, river system, and MLRA.</p>
<p>             Atrazine concentrations in Goodwater Creek Experimental Watershed (GCEW) were shown to be among the very highest of any watershed in the United States based on comparisons using the national Watershed Regressions for Pesticides (WARP) model and by direct comparison with the 112 watersheds used in the development of WARP. The herbicide data collected in GCEW are documented at plot, field, and watershed scales. This 20-yr-long (1991-2010) effort was augmented with a spatially broad effort within the Central Mississippi River Basin encompassing 12 related claypan watersheds in the Salt River Basin, two cave streams on the fringe of the Central Claypan Areas in the Bonne Femme watershed, and 95 streams in northern Missouri and southern Iowa. The research effort on herbicide transport has highlighted the importance of restrictive soil layers with smectitic mineralogy to the risk of transport vulnerability. Near-surface soil features, such as claypans and argillic horizons, result in greater herbicide transport than soils with high saturated hydraulic conductivities and low smectitic clay content.</p>

Switchgrass ESTs and SNPs,"<p>As part of our project, “Developing Association Mapping in Polyploid Perennial Biofuel Grasses” (DOE-USDA Plant Feedstock Genomics for Bioenergy Program grant DE-A102-07ER64454)*, two SNP discovery initiatives were carried out.  The earlier one (2009) was an approach based on EST sequences.  The latest initiative (2011-12) adopted a more powerful approach, based on GBS (Genotyping by Sequencing). We believe that the SNP markers identified in these studies will greatly enhance breeding efforts that target the improvement of key biofuel traits and the development of new switchgrass cultivars.</p>
<p>To enable genome-wide association study (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS) in switchgrass, we genotyped a full-sib population (n =130), a half-sib population (n =168) and association populations (66 pops, n =540). The parents of the linkage populations are upland tetraploids.  The association populations are primarily of the upland ecotype, both tetraploid and octoploid, with a few lowland tetraploids as well. A total of 350 GB of sequence was generated from 840 individuals using GBS. Over 1.2 million putative SNPs were discovered with the UNEAK pipeline.  In addition, ultra-high density paternal and maternal linkage maps, of 41K and 46K SNPs, respectively, were also constructed based on the conserved synteny between switchgrass and foxtail millet.</p>

"TPAC Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in West Lafayette, Indiana","<p>TPAC Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in West Lafayette, Indiana<br />
Recent efforts have attempted to establish emission estimates for greenhouse gases (GHG) from agricultural soils in the United States. This research project was conducted to assess the influence of cropping system management on non-carbon dioxide (non-CO2) GHG emissions from an eastern cornbelt alfisol. Corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) rotation plots were established, as were plots in continuous management of native grasses or Sorghum/Sudan grass. GHG fluxes were monitored throughout each growing season from 2004 through 2007. Fluxes of N2O were significantly correlated with soil temperature (P &lt; 0.001), and thus a Q10 correction was made (3.48 for N2O). Nitrous oxide emissions from corn were lowest from the precision tillage treatment (2.4 kg N ha-1 yr-1), significantly lower than the conventional tillage (4.9 kg N ha-1 yr-1) or cover crop corn treatments (5.0 kg N ha-1 yr-1). Corn-soybean and biomass-based cropping systems resulted in significantly greater N2O emissions than native grasses. There was a positive correlation between N fertilization rate and N2O emissions when comparing all treatments in this study. These soils were typically a sink for atmospheric CH4 for these cropping systems, and thus N2O is the primary non-CO2 GHG of concern. When evaluating the entire cropping system, native grasses resulted in the lowest N2O emissions, while corn-soybean rotation planted with precision tillage resulted in similar N2O emissions as bare soil and were significantly lower than emissions from the other cropping systems assessed.</p>

"Tennessee Valley Study for Resilient Economic Agricultural Practices in Auburn, Alabama","<p>Tennessee Valley Study for Resilient Economic Agricultural Practices in Auburn, Alabama<br />
Maize ( Zea mays L.) produced in narrow rows can increase yields and accelerate canopy closure. Costly equipment modifications make narrow rows impractical, but a twin-row configuration may boost pro­ duction with fewer equipment modifications. Four field experiments were conducted to measure weed biomass, leaf area index (LAI), and yield for a conventional (CN) and a glyphosate-resistant (GR) hybrid across three plant densities (low 4.0–4.4 plants m - 2 ; medium 5.9–6.4 plants m - 2 ; and high 7.9–8.4 plants m - 2 ) and two row configurations (single vs. twin) in a conservation tillage system during the 2005 grow­ ing season. The experimental design was a split–split plot with a RCB arrangement of whole plots where hybrids were assigned to main plots, row configurations to subplots, and plant density to sub-subplots with four replications. Row configuration had little effect on weed biomass compared to plant density and hybrid. Leaf area index increased with higher plant density at all locations. In general, LAI increased with the twin-row configuration, but LAI also varied with hybrid based on interactions between hybrid and plant density or row configuration. Row configuration had little impact on maize yields, while plant density had the most effect on yields. Plant density also interacted with hybrid or row configuration at multiple locations, although maize yields did not always increase with higher plant density. Conventional hybrids may also provide an alternative to GR hybrids, particularly at lower plant densities. Maize yield increases with twin rows were minimal and may not justify twin row conversion under dryland condi­ tions, but growers that already utilize twin-row equipment will not suffer yield decreases by planting twin rows.</p>

Study sites were established in 1995; one in black grama grassland and the other in creosotebush shrubland to compare the impact of herbivores on ecosystem processes between these vegetation types. Parallel studies were established at the Sevilleta LTER site (New Mexico, USA) and Mapimi Biosphere Reserve (Durango, Mexico). Each study site is 1 km by 0.5 km in area. Four replicate experimental blocks were randomly located at each study site to measure vegetation responses using exclusion treatments including a) all mammalian herbivores, including cattle, lagomorphs, and rodents, b) lagomorphs and cattle only, c) cattle only, and d) control accessible to all herbivores. Thirty-six sampling points were positioned at 5.8-meter intervals on a systematically located 6 by 6 point grid within each plot. A permanent one-meter by one-meter vegetation measurement quadrat is located at each of the 36 points. Each spring and fall from 1995-2005, a tape measure was used to measure the length, diameter, and height in centimeters of each termite casing in these vegetation quadrats.

<p>Dr. Bronson modified an old high-clearance Hamby 6000 rig, adding a tank and pump with a rear boom, to perform precision liquid N applications. A Raven control unit with GPS supplied variable rate delivery options.</p>
<p>The 12 volt Holland Scientific GeoScoutX data recorder and associated CropCircle ACS-470 sensors with GPS signal, was easy to mount and run on the vehicle as an attached rugged data acquisition module, and allowed the measuring of plants using custom proximal active optical reflectance sensing. The HS data logger was positioned near the operator, and sensors were positioned in front of the rig, on forward protruding armature attached to a hydraulic front boom assembly, facing downward in nadir view 1 m above the average canopy height. A 34-size class AGM battery sat under the operator and provided the data system electrical power supply.</p>
<p>Data suffered reduced input from Conley. Although every effort was afforded to capture adequate quality across all metrics, experiment exterior considerations were such that canopy temperature data is absent, and canopy height is weak due to technical underperformance. Thankfully, reflectance data quality was maintained or improved through the implementation of new hardware by Bronson.</p>

"The Bushland, Texas Cotton Datasets","<p>This parent dataset (collection of datasets) describes the general organization of data in the datasets for the 2000 through 2004, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2020, and 2021 growing seasons (years) when upland cotton (<em>Gossypium hirsutum</em>, L.) was grown for fiber and seed at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU), Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). Depending on the year and research goals, cotton was grown variously under fully irrigated, deficit irrigated, and dryland conditions and on from one to four large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field also seeded to cotton. See the resource titled “[TBA]” for information on cotton varieties, irrigation regimes and methods, fields planted, planting and harvest dates, etc. The fields were contiguous and were labeled northeast (NE), southeast (SE), northwest (NW), and southwest (SW) as were the lysimeters.  See the resource titled ""<strong><a href=""https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/bushland-texas-maize-grain-datasets/resource/0d9f9b90-a2e5-47c6-bad6-2c9083c82604"">Geographic Coordinates, USDA, ARS, Bushland, Texas</a></strong>"" for UTM geographic coordinates of field and lysimeter locations. Prior to 2013, the fields were irrigated with a linear move sprinkler system equipped with mid elevation spray applicators (MESA). Fields were machine planted, and lysimeters were hand planted to somewhat more plants per square meter than the fields, then thinned to match field plant density after full emergence and plant counts in the fields. Fertilizer and pesticide applications were the same on fields and lysimeters within those fields. The weighing lysimeters were used to measure relative soil water storage to 0.05 mm accuracy at 5-minute intervals, and these data were used to calculate 5-minute change in soil water storage, precipitation, dew and frost accumulation, irrigation amount, and crop evapotranspiration (ET), which are reported at 15-minute intervals. Each lysimeter was equipped with a suite of instruments to sense wind speed, air temperature and humidity, radiant energy (incoming and reflected, typically both shortwave and longwave), surface temperature, soil heat flux, and soil temperature, all of which are reported at 15-min intervals. Instruments used changed from season to season, which is another reason that subsidiary datasets and data dictionaries for each season are required.</p>
<p>Important conventions concerning the data-time correspondence, sign conventions, and terminology specific to the USDA ARS, Bushland, TX, field operations are given in the resource titled ""<strong><a href=""https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/bushland-texas-maize-grain-datasets/resource/30bb4f0a-030c-4dda-bfae-892f8a9423d4"">Conventions for Bushland, TX, Weighing Lysimeter Datasets</a></strong>"".</p>
<p>There are four datasets particular to this collection. Two other datasets common to all Bushland lysimeter studies are: <strong><a href=""https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/soil-water-content-data-bushland-texas-large-weighing-lysimeter-experiments"">Soil Water Content Data for The Bushland, Texas, Large Weighing Lysimeter Experiments</a></strong>, which contains soil volumetric water content data from periodic (weekly or longer periods) readings in two files for each year, one for the east (NE and SE) lysimeters and fields, and one for the west (NW and SW) lysimeters and fields; and <strong><a href=""https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/standard-quality-controlled-research-weather-data-%E2%80%93-usda-ars-bushland-texas"">Standard Quality Controlled Research Weather Data – USDA-ARS, Bushland, Texas</a></strong>, which contains a single file for each year of 15-minute weather data collected at 2-m height over grass. Common symbols and abbreviations used in the datasets are defined in the resource titled, ""<strong><a href=""https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/bushland-texas-maize-grain-datasets/resource/81987778-bbeb-4075-b334-aca8b9a098ce"">Symbols and Abbreviations for Bushland, TX, Weighing Lysimeter Datasets</a></strong>"". Datasets consist of Excel (xlsx) files. Each xlsx file contains an Introductory tab that explains the other tabs, lists the authors, describes conventions and symbols used and lists any instruments used. The remaining tabs in a file consist of dictionary and data tabs. There is a dictionary tab for every data tab. The name of the dictionary tab contains the name of the corresponding data tab. Tab names are unique so that if individual tabs were saved to CSV files, each CSV file in the entire collection would have a different name. The four cotton specific datasets, according to their titles, are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href=""https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/agronomic-calendars-bushland-texas-cotton-datasets"">Agronomic Calendars for the Bushland, Texas Cotton Datasets</a></strong>. Calendars list by date the agronomic practices applied, severe weather, and activities (e.g., planting, thinning, fertilization, pesticide application, lysimeter maintenance, harvest) in and on lysimeters that could influence crop growth and water use. These include fertilizer and pesticide applications. There is one calendar for each year for the NE and SE lysimeters and fields.</li>
<li><strong><a href=""https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/growth-and-yield-data-bushland-texas-cotton-datasets"">Growth and Yield Data for the Bushland, Texas Cotton Datasets</a></strong>: several tabs list by date, field, and replicate number: crop growth [plant height, crop row width, leaf area index, biomass (undried and dried), growth stage, and other growth parameters, population density; machine yield by field location; and hand (manual) harvest statistics per replicated plot (numbers of plants and bolls, total biomass, and dry seed and fiber yield. There is one growth and yield file for each year for the east (NE and SE) fields, and/or one file for the west (NW and SW) fields. Protocols for plant measurements and growth staging changed over the years, requiring different data dictionaries for different growing seasons.</li>
<li><strong><a href=""https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/weighing-lysimeter-data-bushland-texas-cotton-datasets"">Weighing Lysimeter Data for The Bushland, Texas Cotton Datasets</a></strong>: Lysimeter raw data of relative soil water storage (lysimeter mass converted to equivalent depth of water considering the lysimeter surface area), and microclimate (e.g., wind speed, relative humidity, air temperature, short- and long-wave radiation, canopy temperature, soil temperature and heat flux, etc.). Not all properties listed were sensed in every year. There is one file for each year for the east (NE and SE) fields, and/or one file for the west (NW and SW) fields. Lysimeter relative soil water storage (and sometimes rain gauge and wind speed) data are given for 5-minute periods. Other data are given for 15-min periods. For every 5-min storage datum there is a corresponding flag that indicates what is occurring. A separate tab gives daily sums or averages of the sensed properties. For data visualization there is a tab with graphs of the major daily data, another tab with graphs for 15-min data, and a final tab with graphs for 5-min data. The latter two allow viewing data in five-day periods beginning with any day of the year specified by the user.</li>
<li><strong><a href=""https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/evapotranspiration-irrigation-dewfrost-water-balance-data-bushland-texas-cotton-datasets"">Evapotranspiration, Irrigation, Dew/frost - Water Balance Data for The Bushland, Texas Cotton Datasets</a></strong>: In a single file for each year, water balance component data for both lysimeters are given.

"The Bushland, Texas Maize for Grain Datasets","<p>This parent dataset (collection of datasets) describes the general organization of data in the datasets for each growing season (year) when maize (<em>Zea mays</em>, L.) was grown for grain at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU), Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). Maize was grown for grain on between two and four large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. The four fields were contiguous and arranged in four quadrants, which were labeled northeast (NE), southeast (SE), northwest (NW), and southwest (SW). See the resource titled ""<strong><a href=""https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/bushland-texas-maize-grain-datasets/resource/0d9f9b90-a2e5-47c6-bad6-2c9083c82604"">Geographic Coordinates, USDA, ARS, Bushland, Texas</a></strong>"" for UTM geographic coordinates for field and lysimeter locations. Maize was grown on only the NE and SE fields in 1989 and 1990, and on all four fields in 1994, 2013, 2016, and 2018. Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system in 1989, 1990, and 1994, although the system was equipped with various application technologies such as high-pressure impact sprinklers, low pressure spray applications, and low energy precision applicators (LEPA). In 2013, 2016, and 2018, two lysimeters and their respective fields were irrigated using subsurface drip irrigation (SDI), and two lysimeters and their respective fields were irrigated by a linear move sprinkler system equipped with spray applicators. Irrigations were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe from 0.10- to 2.4-m depth in the field. The number and spacing of neutron probe reading locations changed through the years (additional sites were added), which is one reason why subsidiary datasets and data dictionaries are needed. The lysimeters and fields were planted to the same plant density, row spacing, tillage depth (by hand on the lysimeters and by machine in the fields), and fertilizer and pesticide applications. The weighing lysimeters were used to measure relative soil water storage to 0.05 mm accuracy at 5-minute intervals, and the 5-minute change in soil water storage was used along with precipitation, dew and frost accumulation, and irrigation amounts to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ET), which is reported at 15-minute intervals. Each lysimeter was equipped with a suite of instruments to sense wind speed, air temperature and humidity, radiant energy (incoming and reflected, typically both shortwave and longwave), surface temperature, soil heat flux, and soil temperature, all of which are reported at 15-minute intervals. Instruments used changed from season to season, which is another reason that subsidiary datasets and data dictionaries for each season are required.</p>

"The Bushland, Texas Soybean Datasets","<p>This parent dataset (collection of datasets) describes the general organization of data in the datasets for the 1995, 2003, 2004, 2010 and 2019 growing seasons (years) when soybean [<em>Glycine max</em> (L.) Merr.] was grown for seed grain at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU), Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). In 1995, 2003, 2004, and 2010, soybean was grown for seed grain on two large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field also seeded to soybean. The two fields were contiguous, arranged along a north-south axis, and were labeled northeast (NE), and southeast (SE).  In 2019, soybean was grown on four large, precision weighing lysimeters, and on the 4.44 ha square fields surrounding each lysimeter, which were contiguous and labeled NE, SE, and northwest (NW), and southwest (SW).

In 1995, 2003, 2004, and 2010, the fields were irrigated by a linear move sprinkler system equipped with mid elevation spray applicators (MESA). In 2019, the NW and SW fields were irrigated with the linear move sprinkler system equipped with low elevation spray applicators (LESA), while the NE and SE lysimeters and fields were irrigated by subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) with drip tape spaced at 1.52 m in the middle of every other interrow and buried at 0.30 to 0.32 m. Both full and deficit irrigations were applied to fields in 1995, 2003, and 2004. The 2010 crop was grown as a dryland crop with no irrigation other than an initial irrigation to establish the crop. In 2019, full irrigation was applied to all four lysimeters and fields. Except for 2010 and 2019, irrigations on a least one lysimeter were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a neutron probe from 0.10- to 2.4-m depth in the field. The number and spacing of neutron probe reading locations changed through the years (additional sites were added), which is one reason why subsidiary datasets and data dictionaries are needed.

"The Bushland, Texas, Alfalfa Datasets","<p>This parent dataset (collection of datasets) describes the general organization of data in the datasets for each growing season (year) when alfalfa (<em>Medicago sativa</em> L.) was grown as a reference evapotranspiration (ETr) crop at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU), Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). Alfalfa was grown on two large, precision weighing lysimeters, calibrated to NIST standards (Howell et al., 1995). Each lysimeter was in the center of a 4.44 ha square field on which alfalfa was also grown (Evett et al., 2000). The two fields were contiguous and arranged with one (labeled northeast, NE) directly north of the other (labeled southeast, SE). See the resource ""<strong>Geographic Coordinates, USDA, ARS, Bushland, Texas</strong>"" for UTM geographic coordinates for field and lysimeter locations. Alfalfa was planted in Autumn 1995 and grown for hay in 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999. The resource ""<strong>Agronomic Calendar for the Bushland, Texas Alfalfa Datasets</strong>"", gives a calendar listing by date the agronomic practices applied, severe weather, and activities (e.g. planting, thinning, fertilization, pesticide application, lysimeter maintenance, harvest) in and on lysimeters that could influence crop growth, water use, and lysimeter data. These include fertilizer and pesticide applications. There is one calendar, from before planting in autumn 1995 to after final harvest in 1999, for the NE and SE lysimeters and fields. There were 4 harvests each year except 1998 when 5 harvests were taken. Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system equipped with pressure regulated low pressure sprays (mid-elevation spray application, MESA). Irrigations were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings via field-calibrated (Evett and Steiner, 1995) neutron probe from 0.10- to 2.4-m depth in the field. Lysimeters and fields were planted to the same plant density, row spacing, tillage depth (by hand on the lysimeters and by machine in the fields), and fertilizer and pesticide applications. Weighing lysimeters measured relative soil water storage to 0.05 mm accuracy at 5-min intervals, and the 5-min change in soil water storage was used along with precipitation, dew and frost accumulation, and irrigation amounts to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ET), reported at 15-min intervals. Each lysimeter was instrumented to sense wind speed, air temperature and humidity, radiant energy (incoming and reflected, typically both shortwave and longwave), surface temperature, soil heat flux, and soil temperature, all at 15-min intervals.

<p>The soil is a Pullman series fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Torrertic Paleustoll. Soil properties are given in the resource titled ""<strong>Soil Properties for the Bushland, TX, Weighing Lysimeter Datasets</strong>"". Land slope in the lysimeter fields is &lt;0.3% and topography is flat. Mean annual precipitation is ~470 mm, the 20-year pan evaporation record indicates ~2,600 mm Class A pan evaporation per year, and winds are typically from the South and Southwest. Climate is semi-arid with ~70% (350 mm) of the annual precipitation occurring from May to Sep, during which period the pan evaporation averages ~1520 mm. These datasets originate from research on crop water use (ET), reference ET methods for irrigation scheduling, crop coefficients for use in ET-based irrigation scheduling based on a reference ET, crop growth, yield, harvest index, and crop water productivity as affected by irrigation method, timing, amount (full or some degree of deficit), agronomic practices, cultivar, and weather. Prior publications have described the facilities and research methods (Evett et al., 2016), and have focused on alfalfa ET (Todd et al., 1998), the Bowen ratio method applied to alfalfa ET (Todd et al., 2000), comparison of alfalfa ET to ETr calculated from weather data (Evett et al., 1998, 2000), new methods of calculating ETr (Evett et al., 2010, 2012; Lascano and Evett, 2007, 2010; Lascano et al, 2010), and crop water productivity. Crop coefficients (Howell et al., 2006) have been used by ET networks for irrigation management. The data have utility for testing simulation models of crop ET (Colaizzi et al., 2005; Thorp et al., 2019), growth, and yield by several universities and for testing, and calibrating models of ET that use satellite and/or weather data.</p>

"The Bushland, Texas, Winter Wheat Datasets","<p>This parent dataset (collection of datasets) describes the general organization of data in the datasets for each growing season (two-year period) when winter wheat (<em>Triticum aestivum</em> L.) was grown for grain at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU), Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL). Winter wheat was grown on two large, precision weighing lysimeters, calibrated to NIST standards (Howell et al., 1995). Each lysimeter was in the center of a 4.44 ha square field on which wheat was also grown (Evett et al., 2000). The two fields were contiguous and arranged with one directly north of the other. See the resource titled ""<strong><a href=""https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/bushland-texas-maize-grain-datasets/resource/0d9f9b90-a2e5-47c6-bad6-2c9083c82604"">Geographic Coordinates, USDA, ARS, Bushland, Texas</a></strong>"" for UTM geographic coordinates for field and lysimeter locations. Wheat was planted in Autumn and grown over the winter in 1989-1990, 1991-1992, and 1992-1993. Agronomic calendar for the each of the three growing seasons list by date the agronomic practices applied, severe weather, and activities (e.g., planting, thinning, fertilization, pesticide application, lysimeter maintenance, harvest) in and on lysimeters that could influence crop growth, water use, and lysimeter data. These include fertilizer and pesticide applications. Irrigation was by linear move sprinkler system equipped with pressure regulated low pressure sprays (mid-elevation spray application, MESA). Irrigations were managed to replenish soil water used by the crop on a weekly or more frequent basis as determined by soil profile water content readings made with a field-calibrated (Evett and Steiner, 1995) neutron probe from 0.10- to 2.4-m depth in the field. The lysimeters and fields were planted to the same plant density, row spacing, tillage depth (by hand on the lysimeters and by machine in the fields), and fertilizer and pesticide applications. The weighing lysimeters were used to measure relative soil water storage to 0.05 mm accuracy at 5-min intervals, and the 5-min change in soil water storage was used along with precipitation, dew and frost accumulation, and irrigation amounts to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ET), which is reported at 15-min intervals. Each lysimeter was equipped with a suite of instruments to sense wind speed, air temperature and humidity, radiant energy (incoming and reflected, typically both shortwave and longwave), surface temperature, soil heat flux, and soil temperature, all of which are reported at 15-min intervals. Instruments used changed from season to season, which is another reason that subsidiary datasets and data dictionaries for each season are required. The Bushland weighing lysimeter research program was described by Evett et al. (2016), and lysimeter design is described by Marek et al. (1988).

The Cause of Increased Effectiveness of Water-In-Oil Emulsion over Water Application of Trichoderma ovalisporum on Therobroma cacao Pods,"<p>Previous research conducted in Costa Rica determined that <em>Trichoderma ovalisporum</em>, when applied in a water-in-oil emulsion to <em>Theobroma cacao</em> pods, had  less <em>Moniliophthora roreri</em> (frosty pod rot) than in water.  The current research was conducted to determine why bio-control agents when applied to cacao pods were more effective in a water-in-oil emulsion than water for controlling frosty pod rot.  The experiments were conducted in Ecuador in 2011 and 2012.  Two formulations were used: water-in-oil emulsion and water.  Water-sensitive cards were attached to the lower branches of the cacao trees.  There were four trees per treatment and six cards per tree.  One hundred and eighty ml of formulation were applied to each tree with a Stihl SR 420 backpack mist-blower.  The cards underwent droplet analysis with the DepositScan software package. Droplet analysis determined that the increased efficacy of water-in-oil emulsion was the result of the micro-environment advantage of the water-in-oil emulsion.</p>

"The Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) Network Standard GIS Data Layers, 2020 version","<p>The USDA Long-Term Agroecosystem Research was established to develop national strategies for sustainable intensification of agricultural production. As part of the Agricultural Research Service, the LTAR Network incorporates numerous geographies consisting of experimental areas and locations where data are being gathered. Starting in early 2019, two working groups of the LTAR Network (Remote Sensing and GIS, and Data Management) set a major goal to jointly develop a geodatabase of LTAR Standard GIS Data Layers. The purpose of the geodatabase was to enhance the Network's ability to utilize coordinated, harmonized datasets and reduce redundancy and potential errors associated with multiple copies of similar datasets. Project organizers met at least twice with each of the 18 LTAR sites from September 2019 through December 2020, compiling and editing a set of detailed geospatial data layers comprising a geodatabase, describing essential data collection areas within the LTAR Network.</p>
<p>The LTAR Standard GIS Data Layers geodatabase consists of geospatial data that represent locations and areas associated with the LTAR Network as of late 2020, including LTAR site locations, addresses, experimental plots, fields and watersheds, eddy flux towers, and phenocams. There are six data layers in the geodatabase available to the public. This geodatabase was created in 2019-2020 by the LTAR network as a national collaborative effort among working groups and LTAR sites. The creation of the geodatabase began with initial requests to LTAR site leads and data managers for geospatial data, followed by meetings with each LTAR site to review the initial draft. Edits were documented, and the final draft was again reviewed and certified by LTAR site leads or their delegates. Revisions to this geodatabase will occur biennially, with the next revision scheduled to be published in 2023.</p>

The Southwest Watershed Research Center Data Access Project (DAP),"<p>The USDA-ARS Southwest Watershed Research Center (SWRC) operates the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) in southeastern Arizona as an outdoor laboratory for studying semiarid rangeland hydrologic, ecosystem, climate, and erosion processes.</p>
<p>Since its establishment in 1953, the SWRC in Tucson, Arizona, has collected, processed, managed, and disseminated high-resolution, spatially distributed hydrologic data in support of the center's mission. Data management at the SWRC has evolved through time in response to new computing, storage, and data access technologies. In 1996, the SWRC initiated a multiyear project to upgrade rainfall and runoff sensors and convert analog systems to digital electronic systems supported by data loggers. This conversion was coupled with radio telemetry to remotely transmit recorded data to a central computer, thus greatly reducing operational overhead by reducing labor, maintenance, and data processing time. A concurrent effort was initiated to improve access to SWRC data by creating a system based on a relational database supporting access to the data via the Internet. An SWRC team made up of scientists, IT specialists, programmers, hydrologic technicians, and instrumentation specialists was formed. This effort is termed the Southwest Watershed Research Center Data Access Project (DAP).</p>
<p>The goal of the SWRC DAP is to efficiently disseminate data to researchers; land owners, users, and managers; and to the public. Primary access to the data is provided through a Web-based user interface. In addition, data can be accessed directly from within the SWRC network. The first priority for the DAP was to assimilate and make available rainfall and runoff data collected from two instrumented field sites, the WGEW near Tombstone, Arizona, and the Santa Rita Experimental Range (SRER) south of Tucson, Arizona.</p>

Thirteen-year Stover Harvest and Tillage Effects on Corn Agroecosystem Sustainability in Iowa,"<p>This dataset includes soil health, crop biomass, and crop yield data for a 13-year corn stover harvest trial in central Iowa.</p>
<p>Following the release in 2005 of the Billion Ton Study assessment of biofuel sources, several soil health assessments associated with harvesting corn stover were initiated across ARS locations to help provide industry guidelines for sustainable stover harvest. This dataset is from a trial conducted by the National Laboratory for Agriculture and Environment from 2007-2021 at the Iowa State University Ag Engineering and Agronomy farm. Management factors evaluated in the trial included the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Stover harvest rate at three levels: No, moderate (3.5 ± 1.1 Mg ha-1 yr-1), or high (5.0 ± 1.7 Mg ha-1 yr-1) stover harvest rates.</li>
<li>No-till versus chisel-plow tillage. Originally, the 3 stover harvest rates were evaluated in a complete factorial design with tillage system. However, the no-till, no-harvest system performed poorly in continuous corn and was discontinued in 2012 due to lack of producer interest.</li>
<li>Cropping sequence. In addition to evaluating continuous corn for all stover harvest rates and tillage systems, a corn-alfalfa rotation, and a corn-soybean-wheat rotation with winter cover crops were evaluated in a subset of the tillage and stover harvest rate treatments.</li>
<li>One-time additions of biochar in 2013 at rates of either 9 Mg/ha or 30 Mg/ha were evaluated in a continuous corn cropping system.</li>

Transforming Drainage Research Data (USDA-NIFA Award No. 2015-68007-23193),"<p>This dataset contains research data compiled by the “Managing Water for Increased Resiliency of Drained Agricultural Landscapes” project a.k.a. <a href=""https://transformingdrainage.org""><strong>Transforming Drainage</strong></a>. This project was funded from 2015-2021 by the United States Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture (USDA-NIFA, Award No. 2015-68007-23193). Data are also available from a separate web-accessible application (<a href=""https://drainagedata.org""><strong>drainagedata.org</strong></a>). At drainagedata.org, users can visualize the data with customized tools, query based on specific sites and measurements of interest, and access site photographs, maps, summaries, and publications. Additional data or edits made following the publication of this data here at USDA NAL Ag Data Commons will be posted under the Versions tab on drainagedata.org.</p>
<p>These data began in 1996 and include plot- and field-level measurements for 39 experiments across the Midwest and North Carolina. Practices studied include controlled drainage, drainage water recycling, and saturated buffers. In total, 219 variables are reported and span 207 site-years for tile drainage, 154 for nitrate-N load, 181 for water quality, 92 for water table, and 201 for crop yield.</p>
<p>The Transforming Drainage Project worked to advance the process of designing and implementing agricultural drainage systems for storing water in the landscape to improve the resiliency and productivity of agricultural systems. At each site, a control plot was paired with a plot with one of the following three practices to assess impacts.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Controlled Drainage</strong> (CD) is the practice of using a water control structure to raise the depth of the drainage outlet, holding water in the field during periods when drainage is not needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drainage Water Recycling</strong> (DWR) diverts subsurface drainage water into on-farm ponds or reservoirs, where it is stored until it can be used by the crop later in the season through supplemental irrigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Saturated Buffers</strong> (SB) remove nitrate from subsurface drainage water by diverting it into the buffer where it can be taken up by growing vegetation or removed by denitrification.</p>

Turfgrass Soil Carbon Change Through Time: Raw Data and Code,"<p><strong>Data Description</strong><br />
Managed turfgrass is a common component of urban landscapes that is expanding under current land use trends. Previous studies have reported high rates of soil carbon sequestration in turfgrass, but no systematic review has summarized these rates nor evaluated how they change as turfgrass ages. We conducted a meta-analysis of soil carbon sequestration rates from 63 studies. Those data, as well as the code used to analyze them and create figures, are shared here.</p>
<p><strong>Dataset Development</strong><br />
We conducted a systematic review from Nov 2020 to Jan 2021 using Google Scholar, Web of Science, and the Michigan Turfgrass Information File Database. The search terms targeted were ""soil carbon"", ""carbon sequestration"", ""carbon storage"", or “carbon stock”, with ""turf"", ""turfgrass"", ""lawn"", ""urban ecosystem"", or ""residential"", “Fescue”, “Zoysia”, “Poa”, “Cynodon”, “Bouteloua”, “Lolium”, or “Agrostis”. We included only peer-reviewed studies written in English that measured SOC change over one year or longer, and where grass was managed as turf (mowed or clipped regularly). We included studies that sampled to any soil depth, and included several methodologies: small-plot research conducted over a few years (22 datasets from 4 articles), chronosequences of golf courses or residential lawns (39 datasets from 16 articles), and one study that was a variation on a chronosequence method and compiled long-term soil test data provided by golf courses of various ages (3 datasets from Qian & Follett, 2002). In total, 63 datasets from 21 articles met the search criteria.</p>
<p>We excluded 1) duplicate reports of the same data, 2) small plot studies that did not report baseline SOC stocks, and 3) pure modeling studies. We included five papers that only measured changes in SOC concentrations, but not areal stocks (i.e., SOC in Mg ha-1). For these papers, we converted from concentrations to stocks using several approaches. For two papers (Law & Patton, 2017; Y. Qian & Follett, 2002) we used estimated bulk densities provided by the authors. For the chronosequences reported in Selhorst & Lal (2011), we used the average bulk density reported by the author. For the 13 choronosequences reported in Selhorst & Lal (2013), we estimated bulk density from the average relationship between percent C and bulk density reported by Selhorst (2011). For Wang et al. (2014), we used bulk density values from official soil survey descriptions.</p>
<p><strong>Data provenance</strong><br />
In most cases we contacted authors of the studies to obtain the original data. If authors did not reply after two inquiries, or no longer had access to the data, we captured data from published figures using WebPlotDigitizer (Rohatgi, 2021). For three manuscripts the data was already available, or partially available, in public data repositories. Data provenance information is provided in the document ""Dataset summaries and citations.docx"".</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Uses</strong><br />
We recommend the following to data users:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consult and cite the original manuscripts for each dataset, which often provide additional information about turfgrass management, experimental methods, and environmental context. Original citations are provided in the document ""Dataset summaries and citations.docx"".</li>
<li>For datasets that were previously published in public repositories, consult and cite the original datasets, which may provide additional data on turfgrass management practices, soil nitrogen, and natural reference sites. Links to repositories are in the document ""Dataset summaries and citations.docx"".</li>
<li>Consider contacting the dataset authors to notify them of your plans to use the data, and to offer co-authorship as appropriate.</li>

UAS imagery protocols to map vegetation are transferable between dryland sites across an elevational gradient,"<p>This dataset consists of UAS flight images from three sites along an elevation and precipitation gradient within Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed collected between June 4 and July 9, 2019. The lowest elevation site ('wbs1', 1,425 m) was vegetated by shrub steppe dominated Wyoming big sage (<em>Artemisia tridentata</em> ssp. <em>wyomingensis</em>). Vegetation at the middle elevation site ('los1', 1,680 m) was shrub steppe dominated by low sage (<em>Artemisia arbuscula</em>). Shrub steppe at the highest elevation site ('mbs1', 2,110 m) was dominated by mountain big sage (<em>Artemisia tridentata</em> ssp. <em>vaseyana</em>) and Utah snowberry (<em>Symphoricarpos oreophilus utahensis</em>). A MicaSense RedEdge 3 sensor mounted on a DJI Matrice 600 Pro UAS platform was used to collect multispectral imagery of each site. The drone was flown by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 107 certified remote pilot between June 5 and July 9 2019. All flights were completed within two hours of solar noon. The RedEdge is a broadband multispectral sensor: blue (475nm), green (560nm), red (668nm), red edge (717nm), and near-infrared (840nm). The RedEdge sensor was radiometrically calibrated using a reflectance panel before and after each flight. A DJI Phantom 4 with the stock FC330 Red Green Blue (sRGB) camera was flown over each site to collect imagery at a finer spatial resolution to assist with training and test data for vegetation type classification.</p>

UNSATCHEM,"<p>UNSATCHEM is a software package for simulating water, heat, carbon dioxide and solute movement in one-dimensional variably saturated media. The software consists of the UNSCHEM (version 2.0) computer program, and the UNSATCH interactive graphics-based user interface. The UNSCHEM program numerically solves the Richards' equation for variably-saturated water flow and convection-dispersion type equations for heat, carbon dioxide and solute transport. The flow equation incorporates a sink term to account for water uptake by plant roots. The heat transport equation considers transport due to conduction and convection with flowing water. Diffusion in both liquid and gas phases and convection in the liquid phase are considered as CO2 transport mechanisms. The CO2 production model is described. The major variables of the chemical system are Ca, Mg, Na, K, SO4, Cl, NO3, H4SiO4, alkalinity, and CO2. The model accounts for equilibrium chemical reactions between these components such as complexation, cation exchange and precipitation-dissolution. For the precipitation-dissolution of calcite and dissolution of dolomite, either equilibrium or multicomponent kinetic expressions are used which include both forward and back reactions. Other dissolution-precipitation reactions considered include gypsum, hydromagnesite, nesquehonite, and sepiolite. Since the ionic strength of soil solutions can vary considerably with time and space and often reach high values, both modified Debye-Huckel and Pitzer expressions were incorporated into the model as options to calculate single ion activities.</p>
<p>The program may be used to analyze water and solute movement in unsaturated, partially saturated, or fully saturated porous media. The flow region may be composed of nonuniform soils. Flow and transport can occur in the vertical, horizontal, or a generally inclined direction. The water flow part of the model can deal with prescribed head and flux boundaries, boundaries controlled by atmospheric conditions, as well as free drainage boundary conditions. The governing flow and transport equations are solved numerically using finite differences and Galerkin-type linear finite element schemes, respectively.</p>
<p>This report serves as both a user manual and reference document. Detailed instructions are given for data input preparation. A graphics-based user interface, UNSATCH, for data preparation and graphical output display in the MS Windows environment is described in the second part of the manual.</p>

UNSODA 2.0: Unsaturated Soil Hydraulic Database. Database and program for indirect methods of estimating unsaturated hydraulic properties,"<p>This database contains measured soil water retention, hydraulic conductivity, and water diffusivity data, as well as pedological information of some 790 soil samples from around the world.</p>
<p>Quantifying water flow and chemical transport in the vadose zone typically requires knowledge of the unsaturated soil hydraulic properties. The UNsaturated SOil hydraulic DAtabase (UNSODA) was developed to provide a source of unsaturated hydraulic data and some other soil properties for practitioners and researchers. A first MS-DOS version of the database was released in 1996. It has been applied in numerous studies. In this paper, we describe the second version (UNSODA V2.0) for use with Microsoft Access-97®1. The format and structure of the new database have been modified to provide additional and more convenient options for data searches, to provide compatibility with other programs for easy loading and downloading of data, and to allow users to customise the contents and look of graphical output. This paper reviews the structure and contents of the database as well as the operations that can be performed on the different data types in UNSODA V2.0. The use and application of the new database are illustrated with two examples. The retrieval of data is briefly illustrated, followed by a more detailed example regarding the interpolation of soil particle-size distribution data obtained according to different national definitions of particle-size classes. The interpolation procedure, which is based on finding similar particle-size distribution curves from a large European data set, also performed well for soils that originate from other geographical areas.</p>

UPIC,"<p>We introduce here the concept of Unique Pattern Informative Combinations (UPIC), a decision tool for the cost-effective design of DNA fingerprinting/genotyping experiments using simple-sequence/tandem repeat (SSR/STR) markers. After the first screening of SSR-markers tested on a subset of DNA samples, the user can apply UPIC to find marker combinations that maximize the genetic information obtained by a minimum or desirable number of markers. This allows a cost-effective planning of future experiments. We have developed Perl scripts to calculate all possible subset combinations of SSR markers, and determine based on unique patterns or alleles, which combinations can discriminate among all DNA samples included in a test. This makes UPIC an essential tool for optimizing resources when working with microsatellites. An example using real data from eight markers and 12 genotypes shows that UPIC detected groups of as few as three markers sufficient to discriminate all 12-DNA samples. Should markers for future experiments be chosen based only on polymorphism-information content (PIC), the necessary number of markers for discrimination of all samples cannot be determined. We also show that choosing markers using UPIC, an informative combination of four markers can provide similar information as using a combination of six markers (23 vs. 25 patterns, respectively), granting a more efficient planning of experiments. Perl scripts with documentation are also included to calculate the percentage of heterozygous loci on the DNA samples tested and to calculate three PIC values depending on the type of fertilization and allele frequency of the organism.</p>
<p>The UPIC zip file contains 2 perl scripts, a README, and sample input and the resulting outputs. We would appreciate citation if you use them.  As of 1 November, 2010, the zip file also contains an beta optimized script (upic_optimum_v1.1.20101101.pl) that produces a comma separated file, with all the markers that discriminate at least one line, which shows which lines have unique patterns.  This allows you to select markers by score & line.</p>

"USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference Dataset for What We Eat In America, NHANES (Survey-SR)","<p>The dataset, Survey-SR, provides the nutrient data for assessing dietary intakes from the national survey What We Eat In America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (WWEIA, NHANES). Historically, USDA databases have been used for national nutrition monitoring (1). Currently, the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) (2), is used by Food Surveys Research Group, ARS, to process dietary intake data from WWEIA, NHANES. Nutrient values for FNDDS are based on Survey-SR. Survey-SR was referred to as the ""Primary Data Set"" in older publications. Early versions of the dataset were composed mainly of commodity-type items such as wheat flour, sugar, milk, etc. However, with increased consumption of commercial processed and restaurant foods and changes in how national nutrition monitoring data are used (1), many commercial processed and restaurant items have been added to Survey-SR. <br />
 <br />
The current version, Survey-SR 2013-2014, is mainly based on the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR) 28 (2) and contains sixty-six nutrientseach for 3,404 foods. These nutrient data will be used for assessing intake data from WWEIA, NHANES 2013-2014. Nutrient profiles were added for 265 new foods and updated for about 500 foods from the version used for the previous survey (WWEIA, NHANES 2011-12).  New foods added include mainly commercially processed foods such as several gluten-free products, milk substitutes, sauces and condiments such as sriracha, pesto and wasabi, Greek yogurt, breakfast cereals, low-sodium meat products, whole grain pastas and baked products, and several beverages including bottled tea and coffee, coconut water, malt beverages, hard cider, fruit-flavored drinks, fortified fruit juices and fruit and/or vegetable smoothies. Several school lunch pizzas and chicken products, fast-food sandwiches, and new beef cuts were also added, as they are now reported more frequently by survey respondents. Nutrient profiles were updated for several commonly consumed foods such as cheddar, mozzarella and American cheese, ground beef, butter, and catsup. The changes in nutrient values may be due to reformulations in products, changes in the market shares of brands, or more accurate data. Examples of more accurate data include analytical data, market share data, and data from a nationally representative sample.</p>

USDA-ARS Colorado Maize Water Productivity Dataset 2012-2013,"<p>The USDA-Agricultural Research Service carried out an experiment on water productivity in response to seasonal timing of irrigation of maize (<em>Zea mays</em> L.) at the Limited Irrigation Research Farm (LIRF) facility in northeastern Colorado (40°26’ N, 104°38’ W) starting in 2012. Twelve treatments involved different water availability targeted at specific growth-stages. This dataset includes data from the first two years, which were complete years with intact treatments.  Data includes canopy growth and development (canopy height, canopy cover and LAI), irrigation, precipitation, and soil water storage measured periodically through the season; daily estimates of crop evapotranspiration; and seasonal measurement of crop water use, harvest index and crop yield. Hourly and daily weather data are also provided from the CoAgMET, Colorado’s network of meteorological information (<a href=""https://coagmet.colostate.edu/"">https://coagmet.colostate.edu/</a> ; GLY04 station). Additional soil data can be found in a previous dataset (USDA-ARS Colorado Maize Water Productivity Dataset 2008-2011) also available from the Ag Data Commons. This previous dataset included six targeted treatments that were generally uniform through the season. This new dataset can be used to further validate and refine maize crop models.</p>
<p>The data are presented in a spreadsheet format in individual sheets within one workbook. The first sheet in the work book provides a list of data descriptions. Two sheets (one sheet for each of the two years) provide the hourly weather data, with the exception of the precipitation data, which is included in the sheet with daily data per treatment. The weather data is from a weather station on site. Another sheet provides plot level data (harvest index, yield, annual ET, maximum LAI, stand density, total aboveground biomass) taken annually by plot (four plots per treatment). Another sheet provides LAI measured four times over each season per plot. The final sheet provides daily data per treatment over each season, including data needed to compute daily water balance. This sheet has LAI, crop growth stage, plant height, estimated root depth, interpolated canopy cover, ET coefficients, precipitation, and estimated deep percolation, evaporation, and soil water deficit at four soil depths.</p>

"USDA/ARS Kimberly, ID - Furrow Infiltration and Erosion Data, 1998 to 2016","<p>The data are derived from the  field monitoring of irrigated furrows from 1998 to 2016 at the research farm of the USDA/ARS-Northwest Irrigation and Water Research Laboratory in Kimberly, Idaho, USA (south-central Idaho).  For each monitored furrow, irrigation inflow rates, outflow rates, and sediment concentrations were recorded periodically during the irrigation.  A gated pipe conveyed irrigation water across the plots at the head, or inflow-end, of the furrows and adjustable spigots supplied water to each irrigated furrow.  The methodology used to obtain the field data is described by Lentz and Sojka (2009).  Inflows were measured by timing the filling rate of a known volume, and runoff were measured with long-throated, v-notch flumes. Outflows were measured and runoff samples collected at 30 min intervals during the first 1-3 hr of an irrigation, and every hour or two for the next 3 to 5 hr.  If the set was continued for an additional 12 hr, two to four additional measurements were made.  Immediately after each flume reading, sediment concentration in furrow streams were measured by collecting one-liter runoff samples from free-flowing flume discharge.  The weight of sediment per liter of runoff was determined from the settled volume of sediment using the Imhoff-cone technique.  Three Imhoff-cone sediment samples were collected from each treatment in each irrigation.  These were filtered, and the papers dried and weighed.  A calibration function relating the 30-min, settled-sediment volume to sediment mass-per-unit-volume of runoff was then calculated and used to convert settled sediment volume in cones to sediment mass.</p>
<p>The field data for each study or year were analyzed using the WASHOUT program (Lentz and Sojka, 1995).  The WASHOUT program produces an output file (filename.out), which become components of this Ag Data Commons data set.</p>
<p>For many years and irrigations, furrows were monitored at one or more locations along the furrow, as well as at the end (bottom) of the furrow.  In these cases, data for each position within the furrow are listed in the data set, labelled for example as 'Top', 'Middle', and 'Bottom' (See Data Dictionary tab).  For each furrow position the data represent the flow, infiltration, and runoff information for the length of furrow, which begins at its inflow end (top of the field) and ends at the defined furrow position.  This distance is listed in the field data file for each furrow and irrigation.</p>
<p>An Irrigation Data Summary is included as a tab in the data set spreadsheet.  This is a summary list of the studies and irrigations that are included in the data set.

USLE Project,"<p>The USLE_1981-4 project data (Universal Soil Loss Equation) was collected from of (9) sites at (4) locations. A Swanson rotating boom simulator with (30) V-Jet 80100 nozzles applied rainfall at two different intensities, 60 or 130 mm/hour depending on how many nozzles were turned on.  Specially designed flumes used with the FW-1 automatic water level recorder were used to obtain continuous runoff flow measurements. The sites in this data set followed a standardized rainfall simulator protocol which future studies by multiple investigators would continue to use. The data set contains rainfall simulator hydrologic and erosion data as well as vegetation and ground data collected in spring and fall from 1981 to 1984.</p>
<p>All sites had (3) treatments with (2) replications.  The vegetative plot manipulation treatments were: clipped, all vegetation clipped at ground surface and removed, bare, vegetation clipped and removed with all rocks larger than 5 mm removed, natural, vegetation left natural, tilled, all vegetation removed and soil tilled. Dataset data was published in Proceedings of the Rainfall Simulator Workshop 1985 Tucson, AZ in table format appendices.  There is also (8) supporting data files with related site data.

<p>The Uniform Soybean Testing Program has been directed toward the testing of elite breeding lines that ultimately leads to the release of varieties. Breeding lines are developed and evaluated in several participating federal and state research programs. As breeding lines demonstrate specific qualities in the individual programs, they are advanced to the preliminary and uniform regional tests conducted in cooperation with research workers in the southern states. This testing program enables breeders to evaluate new strains under a wide variety of conditions, and permits new strains to be put into production in a minimum amount of time.</p>
<p>A wide range of soil and climatic conditions exists in the regions. As an aid in recognizing regional adaptation, the region has been subdivided into five rather broad areas which still represent a wide range of soil types. These are: (1) the East Coast, consisting of the Coastal Plain and Tidewater areas of the eastern shore of Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and the upper half of South Carolina; (2) the Southeast, consisting primarily of the Coastal Plain soils of the Gulf Coast area, but also including similar soil from South Carolina, southward; (3) the Upper and Central South, including the Piedmont and loessial hill soils east of the Mississippi River; (4) the Delta area, composed of the alluvial soils along the Mississippi River from southern Missouri, southward; and (5) the West, comprising Arkansas and Louisiana (outside the Delta), Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.

Water quality data collection in the SGPRW began in the 1960s and continued through 1978, while that in the LWREW covered the 1960s to 1990 period. Data collection began in the FCREW in 2004 and continues through the present.</p>
<p>The data were collected from streams, unit source watersheds, groundwater wells, and reservoirs. It should be noted that various forms of P—reactive P, total P, soluble P, water-soluble P, particulate P, bioavailable P, total water-soluble P—were measured and are described here as given in the original data sets.

"Vegetation cover data from line-intercept transects in the long-term Small Mammal Exclusion Study (SMES) at Jornada Basin LTER, 1995-2005","<p>This package contains perennial vegetation cover data measured using the line-intercept method from plots with various levels of herbivore exclusion on Jornada Experimental Range (JER) and Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center (CDRRC) lands. Study sites were established in 1995; one in black grama grassland and the other in creosotebush shrubland to compare the impact of herbivores on ecosystem processes between these vegetation types. Parallel studies were established at the Sevilleta LTER site (New Mexico, USA) and Mapimi Biosphere Reserve (Durango, Mexico). Each study site is 1 km by 0.5 km in area. Four replicate experimental blocks were randomly located at the grassland study site to measure vegetation responses using exclusion treatments including a) all mammalian herbivores, including cattle, lagomorphs, and rodents, b) lagomorphs and cattle only, c) cattle only, and d) control accessible to all herbivores. Because grazing cattle are excluded from the entire creosote site, only three replicate experimental blocks were randomly located there including a) all mammalian herbivores, including lagomorphs, and rodents, b) lagomorphs only, and c) control accessible to all herbivores. Thirty-six sampling points were positioned at 5.8-meter intervals on a systematically located 6 by 6 point grid within each plot. A permanent one-meter by one-meter vegetation measurement quadrat is located at each of the 36 points. The vegetation line-intercept measurements in this data package were made in fall 1995 and fall 2005 to coincide with low-level aerial photography campaigns. Three 29-meter lines were measured along three out of six rows of permanent vegetation quadrats. Intercept locations for live, perennial plant cover and bare ground were measured along each line at 10cm resolution, which is comparable to the resolution of the aerial photos. Plants were identified to species level where possible. The resulting cover data can used to ground-truth cover estimates from aerial photography or for comparison to annual measures of vegetation from 1 x 1 meter permanent vegetation quadrats.

"Vegetation cover from line intercept transects in lagomorph exclosure and shrub removal plots at the Jornada Experimental Range, southern New Mexico, USA, 1938-2001","<p>This package contains data from a study to quantify vegetation dynamics in response to lagomorph and shrub exclusion on the Jornada Experimental Range from 1938-2001. Data consist of vertical line intercept measures of the perennial grasses, suffretescents and shrubs. Sixteen plots at each of 3 sites (Gravelly Ridges, Dona Ana exclosure, and Parker Tank) were established in 1938-39. Plots were 21.3 x 21.3 m with a 7.6 m buffer zone between each. Plots were divided into east and west halves and 14 randomly located 10.65 m transects were located in each half plot. Vegetation was measured using vertical line intercepts in 1938, 1947, 1956, 1960, 1967, 1989, 1995, and 2001 for the Gravelly Ridges site, and in 1938/9, 1947, 1960, 1967, and 2001 for the Parker Tank and Dona Ana sites. The treatments include lagomorph exclusion (using wire fencing), shrub removal (hand grubbing at the ground surface), furrowing (shallow, hand raked furrows to trap surface water), and seeding (broadcast applications of seeds of native perennials). Seeding and furrowing treatments were only applied in 1939. Lagomorph exclusion has persisted since establishment, and shrub removal treatments have been reapplied immediately following all years of vegetation sampling. The dataset contains information on the site, year of data collection, plot number, line number, vegetation, and number of vegetation present on each line.

"Vegetation, rainfall simulation, and overland flow experiments before and after tree removal in woodland-encroached sagebrush steppe: the SageSTEP hydrology study","<p>Simulated rainfall and overland-flow experiments are useful for enhancing understanding of surface hydrologic and erosion processes, quantifying runoff and erosion rates, and developing and testing predictive quantitative models. This extensive dataset (1021 experimental plots) consists of rainfall simulation (1300 plot runs, 0.5 m2 to 13 m2 scales) and overland flow (838 plot runs, ~9 m2 scale) experimental plot data coupled with associated measures of vegetation, ground cover, and surface soil properties across point to hillslope scales. The data were collected at three woodland-encroached sagebrush (<em>Artemisia</em> spp.) rangelands in the Great Basin, USA, under undisturbed/untreated conditions and 1 yr to 9 yr following fire and/or mechanical tree-removal treatments. The methodology employed and resulting experimental data contribute to quantifying and understanding scale-dependent surface hydrologic and erosion processes for Great Basin woodlands and sagebrush rangelands before and after tree removal and for sparsely vegetated sites elsewhere. The dataset is a valuable source for developing and testing hydrology and erosion models for applications to diverse vegetation and ground cover conditions. Lastly, the series of repeated measures in the dataset for some sites over time provides a valuable dataset for exploring long-term landscape vegetation and hydrologic and erosion responses to various land management practices and disturbances.</p>
<p>The resulting collective dataset of 1021 experimental plots contains vegetation, ground cover, soils, hydrology, and erosion data collected across multiple spatial scales, diverse cover and surface conditions, three study sites, and five different study years. The collective dataset contains 57 plots at the hillslope scale (site characterization plots), 528 small-rainfall plots, 146 large-rainfall plots, and 290 overland-flow plots. The hydrology and erosion experiments yielded time series datasets for small-rainfall plot, large-rainfall plot, and overland-flow plot simulations. Some time series hydrographs and sedigraphs from rainfall and overland flow simulations were excluded due to various equipment failures. The final time series datasets consist of 1020 small-rainfall, 280 large-rainfall, and 838 overland-flow plot run hydrographs and sedigraphs, not excluding plots without runoff. Restricting the data to plots that generated runoff results in 749 small-rainfall, 251 large-rainfall, and 719 overland-flow plot simulation hydrographs and sedigraphs. Overall, the hydrology and erosion time series dataset amounts to 2138 hydrographs/sedigraphs including plots with zero runoff and 1719 hydrographs/sedigraphs for plots that generated runoff.</p>

Virtual Grower 3,"<p>Several years ago, our group released the Virtual Grower software to the public.  Initially designed to help greenhouse growers determine heating costs and do simple simulations to figure out where heat savings could be achieved, it has slowly added features so that now, Virtual Grower can help not only identify those savings through different greenhouse designs, but predict crop growth, assist in scheduling, make real-time predictions of energy use, and see the impact of supplemental lighting on plant growth and development. In other words, the software can be a safety net and allow users to experiment with ""what if"" scenarios in a risk-free setting.</p>
<p>Virtual Grower 3.0 is the next installment in the software series.  Released in August, 2011, this version is the first to be both Mac- and PC-compatible, meaning no one is excluded from being able to use the software.  Return users will find the same easy-to-use sections for designing greenhouse structures, heating systems, and lighting systems, and adding up to 40 plant species or varieties to your simulation.</p>
<p>New Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The new version has nearly 800 locations across the U.S. represented by their weather, which is an increase of over 500 sites.</li>
<li>Many of the new and old features are bolstered with graphics including a location map, photographs, responsive schematic drawings of your simulated greenhouse, and graphs and charts of the output.</li>
<li>Virtual Grower 3 can now accommodate dual-stage heating systems and apply them to as many greenhouses as you want.  This allows for the simulation of the increasingly common case of having a very high-efficiency system running most of the time and a lower-efficiency, less expensive system supply heat when additional heat is needed during cold periods.</li>
<li>Users can now enter a target finish date and ""backtrack"" to predict when the crop should be started from plug stage.</li>
<li>Students in the greenhouse industry can view photographs and track down additional information for all of the crops included in the software.</li>
<li>Improved support in instructional videos.</li>

WEPPCAT,"<p>Global warming is expected to lead to a more vigorous hydrological cycle, including more total rainfall and more frequent high intensity rainfall events. Rainfall amounts and intensities increased on average in the United States during the 20th century and, according to climate change models, they are expected to continue to increase during the 21st century. These rainfall changes, along with expected changes in temperature, solar radiation, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations, will have significant impacts on soil erosion rates. The processes involved in the impact of climate change on soil erosion by water are complex, involving changes in rainfall amounts and intensities, number of days of precipitation, ratio of rain to snow, plant biomass production, plant residue decomposition rates, soil microbial activity, evapo-transpiration rates, and shifts in land use necessary to accommodate a new climatic regime. WEPPCAT is a web-based erosion simulation tool that allows for the assessment of changes in erosion rates as a consequence of user-defined climate change scenarios. This tool is based on the USDA-ARS Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) erosion model. It has the capability of taking into account all of the erosion-affecting processes listed above.</p>

WISDEM,"<p>WISDEM simulates the variation in multi-species weed populations over time in response to crop rotation, tillage system, and specific weed management tactics and the consequent crop yield loss due to weed competition. Population dynamics of individual weed species are predicted from a limited number of parameters that can be derived from literature sources and expert opinion.</p>
<p>Data to model the population dynamics and crop yield loss of multi-species weed populations is extremely limited as well as expensive and time-consuming to obtain. WISDEM simulates population dynamics of multi-species weed populations in response to crop rotation, tillage system, and specific weed management tactics as well as the resulting crop yield reduction from weed competition.  The model uses an innovative structure for modeling weed population dynamics that requires only a small number of parameters and these can be readily derived from literature sources and regional surveys of weed experts. The structure is based on the general theory of density dependence of plant productivity and the extensive use of rectangular hyperbolic equations for describing crop yield as a function of weed density. Only two density-independent parameters are required for each species to represent differences in seed bank mortality, seedling emergence and maximum seed production. One equation is used to model crop yield loss and density-dependent weed seed production as a function of crop and weed density, relative time of weed and crop emergence and differences among species in competitive ability. WISDEM has been parameterized for 4 crops and 15 weeds of the Great Plains. A preliminary, limited evaluation provides evidence that predictions of yield loss from single species of weeds and the short term trajectories of changes in weed populations are biologically reasonable. We think the accuracy is sufficient for the goal of modeling general trends in population density accurately enough to highlight potential weed problems and solutions when comparing alternative crop management options for a field.</p>

"WQFS Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in West Lafayette, Indiana","<p>WQFS Study for Greenhouse gas Reduction through Agricultural Carbon Enhancement network in West Lafayette, Indiana<br />
Relative contributions of diverse, managed ecosystems to greenhouse gases are not completely documented. This study was conducted to estimate soil surface fluxes of carbon dioxide  (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2 O) as affected by management practices and weather. Gas fluxes were measured by vented, static chambers in Drummer and Raub soil series during two growing seasons. Treatments evaluated were corn cropped continuously (CC) or in rotation with soybean (CS) and fertilized with in-season urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN) or liquid swine manure applied in the spring or fall. Soybean (SC) rotated with CS and restored prairie grass (RP) were also included. The CO2 fluxes correlated (P≤0.001) with soil temperature (ρ: 0.74) and accumulated rainfall 120 h before sampling (ρ: 0.53); N2O fluxes correlated with soil temperature (ρ: 0.34). Seasonal CO2–C emissions were not different across treatments (4.4 Mg ha−1 yr−1) but differed between years. Manured soils were net seasonal CH4–C emitters (0.159–0.329 kg ha−1 yr−1), whereas CSUAN and CCUAN Treatments significantly influenced seasonal N2O–N emissions (P&lt; 0.001) and ranged from &lt;1.0 kg ha−1yr−1in RP and SC to between 3 and 5 kg ha−1yr−1in CC (fall application) and CSUAN and &gt;8 kg ha−1yr−1in CC (spring application); differences were driven by pulse emissions after N fertilization in concurrence with major rainfall events. These results suggest fall manure application, corn–soybean rotation, and restoration of prairies may diminish N2O emissions and hence contribute to global warming mitigation.</p>

The WGEW is a tributary of the San Pedro River, surrounds the town of Tombstone in southeastern Arizona, and has a drainage area of approximately 149 km2. Elevation of the watershed ranges from 1220 m to 1950 m above mean sea level (MSL). Average annual precipitation for the period of 1956-2005, as measured with six gauges, is roughly 312 mm, with approximately 60% falling during the summer monsoon. Precipitation consists almost solely of rainfall with relatively rare instances of hail and snowfall. From a historical high of 95 rain gauges, a current network of 88 gauges is operational. This constitutes one of the densest rain gauge networks in the world (0.6 gauges/km2) for watersheds greater than 10 km2. Through 1999, the network consisted of analog recording weighing rain gauges. In 2000, a newly designed digital gauge with telemetry was placed adjacent (1 m) to the analog gauges. Both the analog and digital networks of gauges were in operation from 2000 to 2005 to enable a comparative analysis of the two systems. The analog data were digitized from paper charts and were stored in breakpoint format. The digital data consist of rainfall depths at 1-min intervals during periods of rainfall.</p>

"Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed, Arizona (Runoff)","<p>The Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) runoff database has the longest period of record of runoff in the world for a semiarid location, with data collection beginning in 1953. Runoff occurs at Walnut Gulch primarily as a result of convective thunderstorms during the months of July through September. Runoff volume and flow duration are correlated with drainage area as a result of the limited areal extent of runoff producing rainfall and transmission losses or infiltration of the flood wave into the channel alluvium. Runoff is measured at three ranges of watershed size: small, 0.0018-0.059 km2; medium, 0.35-1.60 km2; and large, 2.27-149 km2. The small watersheds are termed ‘‘unit source area watersheds'' and were established to quantify the interaction of rainfall intensity patterns, soils, vegetation, and management on the rates and amounts runoff and sediment production. The medium watersheds were established at preexisting small earthen dams or stock tanks to obtain inexpensive measurements of storm runoff volume and annual sediment yield. The large watersheds were established to quantify the effects of the spatial and temporal variability of thunderstorm rainfall and channel characteristics on water yield, peak discharge, and sediment yield. Runoff was originally measured using a stilling well, float, and analog stage recorders (Stevens A-35, Friez FD-4, Friez FW-1) with mechanical clocks to record the timing of the event. In 1999, digital recorders consisting of potentiometers attached to the stilling well gear mechanism and a Campbell Scientific CR-10 data logger were added to all of the runoff measurement stations. At present, both the analog and digital data are being collected and are archived.</p>

"Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed, Arizona (Sediment)","<p>The Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) sediment collection program, established in 1953, provides event-based data for semiarid rangeland erosion, sediment transport, and yield research. Sediment loads carried through the channel network on the WGEW are high, but are typical of semiarid rangelands, and are influenced by soils, geologic parent material, and geomorphology. Typical monsoon thunderstorm generated flows in dryland regions are characterized by high velocities, short durations, and heavy and coarse sediment loads. Sediment is measured in conjunction with discharge measurements [Stone et al., 2008] that are integral to converting sample values to runoff event-based values. Sampling initiated in the 1960s was done with point intake pump samplers. The single point sampler intake tubes were later replaced with tubes that rise in response to flow and are perforated to collect depth integrated samples. Sampling with each of these systems is limited to suspended sediment smaller than the 0.635 cm diameter of the intake slots. Pump samplers are in use at the outlet of small watersheds where overland flow is the dominant hydrologic driver of sediment transport, and particles are small. As watershed size increases on the WGEW, in general, the channel network can dominate sediment delivery processes as it evolves to carry an increasingly coarse, and vertically sorted, sediment load. A traversing slot sediment sampler was designed in response to limitations of alternative sampling methods such as the pump sampler. The data collection network was expanded in 2002 and pit traps were added below the overfall at flumes 63.103 and 63.104. Analysis of these data, and efforts to process and make available the historic data, are ongoing.</p>

"Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed, Kendall (Carbon Dioxide and Water Flux)","<p>Atmospheric carbon dioxide and moisture concentrations were measured with an infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) (LI-6262, LI-COR, Inc. Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). Measurements were made from 1997 through the present at the Kendall site. The meteorological data and Bowen ratio energy balance systems (BREB) (Model 023/CO2 Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, Utah, USA) data are used to calculate carbon dioxide and evapotranspiration (ET) fluxes. The stored Bowen ration instrument data from the measurement site were transmitted by radio daily to our research station in Tombstone, AZ. From there, they were transferred through an Internet connection to Tucson, AZ. The data were then divided into 5-day increments and inserted into a Quattro1 Pro spreadsheet file which had all the formulations to calculate flux of soil heat, latent heat, sensible heat, evapotranspiration rates (ET), and CO2 rates on the 20-min time step of the data. All instrument and calculated data were graphed in the spreadsheet file and thoroughly reviewed for any instrument problems or data stream collection issues.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide and water fluxes are important components of watershed function. In order to study carbon dioxide and water flux as they exist over the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW), two sites were selected on the basis of their ecosystem composition, one site being dominated by shrubs and the other a grass dominated plant community. The grass site is identified as Kendall (109560800W, 314401000N; elevation; 1526 m). The soils at the Kendall site are a complex of Stronghold (coarse-loamy, mixed, thermic Ustollic Calciorthids), Elgin (fine, mixed, thermic, Ustollic Paleargids), and McAllister (fine-loamy, mixed, thermic, Ustollic Haplargids) soils, with Stronghold the dominant soil [NRCS Soil Survey, 2003]. Slopes range from 4 to 9%.

Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP),"<p>The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model is a process-based, distributed parameter, continuous simulation, erosion prediction model for use on personal computers running Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP/Vista/Windows7. The current model version (v2012.8) available for download is applicable to hillslope erosion processes (sheet and rill erosion), as well as simulation of the hydrologic and erosion processes on small watersheds. Included in the download package is the WEPP model (version 2012.8), WEPP Windows interface (August 2012), CLIGEN climate generators (versions 4.3 and 5.3), documentation and example data.</p>
<p>The objective of the Water Erosion Prediction Project is to develop new generation prediction technology for use by the USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service, USDA-Forest Service, USDI-Bureau of Land Management, and others involved in soil and water conservation and environmental planning and assessment. This improved erosion prediction technology is based on modern hydrologic and erosion science, is process-oriented, and is computer-implemented. This document is a detailed description of the WEPP erosion model as developed for application to small watersheds and hillslope profiles within those watersheds. The WEPP erosion model is a continuous simulation computer program which predicts soil loss and sediment deposition from overland flow on hillslopes, soil loss and sediment deposition from concentrated flow in small channels, and sediment deposition in impoundments. In addition to the erosion components, it also includes a climate component which uses a stochastic generator to provide daily weather information, a hydrology component which is based on a modified Green-Ampt infiltration equation and solutions of the kinematic wave equations, a daily water balance component, a plant growth and residue decomposition component, and an irrigation component. The WEPP model computes spatial and temporal distributions of soil loss and deposition, and provides explicit estimates of when and where in a watershed or on a hillslope that erosion is occurring so that conservation measures can be selected to most effectively control soil loss and sediment yield.</p>

WeedSite,"<p>Software for learning about the benefits of site-specific weed management compared to a uniform herbicide application. No GIS software is needed. The benefits are predicted from weed maps drawn by the user.</p>
<p>Herbicide use may be reduced 30 to 80% without impacting crop yield with site-specific weed management.  Herbicide use is varied within a field to match the variation in the weed population.  However, it is not always clear that the reduction in herbicide and other benefits of site-specific weed management will justify the cost and that future weed control will not be compromised.  The outcomes of site-specific weed management vary with the composition and spatial distribution of the weed population, possible herbicide treatments and the resolution of variable management. WeedSite software was developed for predicting the benefits of postemergence site-specific weed management in irrigated corn and how the benefits vary with the weed population and the approach for variable herbicide application. Georeferenced weed maps and GIS software are not needed. Net gain from site-specific weed management, area of the field not treated, herbicide use and cost, yield loss from weed competition, and weeds left in the field are all calculated from hand drawn weed maps. Results can be mapped. WeedSite is useful for educating growers, agricultural consultants and students about the potential benefits of postemergence site-specific weed management because predictions are consistent with what is known about the variation in the benefits of site-specific weed management. Also, users specify the distribution of weeds in a field, so the results may be more relevant to them than information from research studies.</p>

Alfalfa was grown on two large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. The weighing lysimeters were used to measure mass, which was converted to relative soil water storage with 0.05 mm accuracy at 5-minute intervals, and the 5-minute change in soil water storage was used along with precipitation and irrigation amounts to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ET), which is reported at 15-minute intervals. Although a quality control process was used, the ET data in this dataset are considered raw data. Advanced algorithms for detection of precipitation, dew and frost were applied in a separate process to determine ET values that are reported in files in a dataset entitled ""Evapotranspiration and Water Balance Data for The Bushland, Texas Alfalfa Datasets"". Those files have ""water-balance"" in their names. Each lysimeter was equipped with a suite of instruments to sense wind speed, air temperature and relative humidity, components of the radiation balance (e.g., net radiation, incoming and reflected shortwave, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), incoming and reflected longwave, thermal infrared emitted by the plant/soil surface), soil heat flux, soil temperature, and soil volumetric water content at certain depths.

"Weighing Lysimeter Data for The Bushland, Texas Sunflower Datasets","<p>This dataset consists of two years of weighing lysimeter data for sunflower grown at the USDA-ARS Conservation and Production Laboratory (CPRL), Soil and Water Management Research Unit (SWMRU), Bushland, Texas (Lat. 35.186714°, Long. -102.094189°, elevation 1170 m above MSL) in 2009 and 2011. Sunflower was grown on two large, precision weighing lysimeters, each in the center of a 4.44 ha square field. The weighing lysimeters were used to measure mass, which was converted to relative soil water storage with 0.05 mm accuracy at 5-minute intervals, and the 5-minute change in soil water storage was used along with precipitation and irrigation amounts to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ET), which is reported at 15-minute intervals. Although a quality control process was used, the ET data in this dataset are considered raw data. Advanced algorithms for detection of precipitation, dew and frost were applied in a separate process to determine ET values that are reported in files in a dataset entitled ""<a href=""https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/evapotranspiration-irrigation-dewfrost-water-balance-data-bushland-texas-sunflower-datasets"">Evapotranspiration and Water Balance Data for The Bushland, Texas Sunflower Datasets</a>"". Those files have ""water-balance"" in their names. Each lysimeter was equipped with a suite of instruments to sense wind speed, air temperature and relative humidity, components of the radiation balance (e.g., net radiation, incoming and reflected shortwave, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), incoming and reflected longwave, thermal infrared emitted by the plant/soil surface), soil heat flux, soil temperature, and soil volumetric water content at certain depths. Not all properties were always sensed in any one year; and instruments used changed from season to season, which are reasons that subsidiary datasets and data dictionaries for each season are required.<br />
These datasets originate from research aimed at determining crop water use (ET), crop coefficients for use in ET-based irrigation scheduling based on a reference ET, crop growth, yield, harvest index, and crop water productivity as affected by irrigation method, timing, amount (full or some degree of deficit), agronomic practices, cultivar, and weather. Prior publications have focused on sunflower ET, crop coefficients, crop water productivity, and simulation modeling of crop growth, water use, and yield.

West Texas Mesonet Agro-Climate Monitor,"<p>West Texas Mesonet Agro-Climate Monitor shows the precipitation, temperature, weather forecast for mesonet stations in West Texas. Although dependent on rainfall and other climate factors to produce crops, West Texas crop consultants, extension agents, and agricultural producers have few tools that allow them to track the current growing season’s climate conditions and determine how current conditions compare with those of past years. The West Texas Mesonet Agro-Climate Monitor (ACM), a JavaScript web application based on daily data from Texas Tech University’s mesonet weather station network, was designed to meet this need. By displaying continuously updated information on variables such as soil temperature, cumulative growing degree days (GDD), cumulative precipitation, and first freeze dates, the ACM allows producers to monitor planting conditions, track crop development, and compare current conditions with those during the previous 10 yr’s growing seasons. In illustrating how mesonet data might be used as an operational climate data resource, the ACM might also serve as a conceptual model for other high resolution climate tools that estimate measures of current climate using continuously updated daily data sets.</p>

What We Eat In America (WWEIA) Database,"<p>What We Eat in America (WWEIA) is the dietary intake interview component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).<br />
WWEIA is conducted as a partnership between the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Two days of 24-hour dietary recall data are collected through an initial in-person interview, and a second interview conducted over the telephone within three to 10 days. Participants are given three-dimensional models (measuring cups and spoons, a ruler, and two household spoons) and/or USDA's Food Model Booklet (containing drawings of various sizes of glasses, mugs, bowls, mounds, circles, and other measures) to estimate food amounts. WWEIA data are collected using USDA's dietary data collection instrument, the Automated Multiple-Pass Method (AMPM). The AMPM is a fully computerized method for collecting 24-hour dietary recalls either in-person or by telephone. </p>
<p>For each 2-year data release cycle, the following dietary intake data files are available:</p>
<ul><strong>Individual Foods File</strong> - Contains one record per food for each survey participant. Foods are identified by USDA food codes. Each record contains information about when and where the food was consumed, whether the food was eaten in combination with other foods, amount eaten, and amounts of nutrients provided by the food.</ul>
<ul><strong>Total Nutrient Intakes File</strong> - Contains one record per day for each survey participant. Each record contains daily totals of food energy and nutrient intakes, daily intake of water, intake day of week, total number foods reported, and whether intake was usual, much more than usual or much less than usual. The Day 1 file also includes salt use in cooking and at the table; whether on a diet to lose weight or for other health-related reason and type of diet; and frequency of fish and shellfish consumption (examinees one year or older, Day 1 file only).</ul>
<p>DHHS is responsible for the sample design and data collection, and USDA is responsible for the survey’s dietary data collection methodology, maintenance of the databases used to code and process the data, and data review and processing. USDA also funds the collection and processing of Day 2 dietary intake data, which are used to develop variance estimates and calculate usual nutrient intakes.</p>

"X-ray CT data with semantic annotations for the paper ""A workflow for segmenting soil and plant X-ray CT images with deep learning in Google’s Colaboratory""","<p>Leaves from  genetically unique <em>Juglans regia</em> plants were scanned using X-ray micro-computed tomography (microCT) on the X-ray μCT beamline (8.3.2) at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) in Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), Berkeley, CA USA).</p>
<p>Soil samples were collected in Fall of 2017 from the riparian oak forest located at the Russell Ranch Sustainable Agricultural Institute at the University of California Davis. The soil was sieved through a 2 mm mesh and was air dried before imaging. A single soil aggregate was scanned at 23 keV using the 10x objective lens with a pixel resolution of 650 nanometers on beamline 8.3.2 at the ALS.</p>
<p>Additionally, a drought stressed almond flower bud (<em>Prunus dulcis</em>) from a plant housed at the University of California, Davis, was scanned using a 4x lens with a pixel resolution of 1.72 µm on beamline 8.3.2 at the ALS</p>
<p>Raw tomographic image data was reconstructed using TomoPy. Reconstructions were converted to 8-bit tif or png format using ImageJ or the PIL package in Python before further processing.  Images were annotated using Intel’s Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT) and ImageJ. Both CVAT and ImageJ are free to use and open source. Leaf images were annotated in following Théroux-Rancourt et al. (2020). Specifically, Hand labeling was done directly in ImageJ by drawing around each tissue; with 5 images annotated per leaf.  Care was taken to cover a range of anatomical variation to help improve the generalizability of the models to other leaves. All slices were labeled by Dr. Mina Momayyezi and Fiona Duong.To annotate the flower bud and soil aggregate, images were imported into CVAT. The exterior border of the bud (i.e. bud scales) and flower were annotated in CVAT and exported as masks. Similarly, the exterior of the soil aggregate and particulate organic matter identified by eye were annotated in CVAT and exported as masks. To annotate air spaces in both the bud and soil aggregate, images were imported into ImageJ. A gaussian blur was applied to the image to decrease noise and then the air space was segmented using thresholding. After applying the threshold, the selected air space region was converted to a binary image with white representing the air space and black representing everything else. This binary image was overlaid upon the original image and the air space within the flower bud and aggregate was selected using the “free hand” tool. Air space outside of the region of interest for both image sets was eliminated. The quality of the air space annotation was then visually inspected for accuracy against the underlying original image; incomplete annotations were corrected using the brush or pencil tool to paint missing air space white and incorrectly identified air space black. Once the annotation was satisfactorily corrected, the binary image of the air space was saved. Finally, the annotations of the bud and flower or aggregate and organic matter were opened in ImageJ and the associated air space mask was overlaid on top of them forming a three-layer mask suitable for training the fully convolutional network. All labeling of the soil aggregate and soil aggregate images was done by Dr. Devin Rippner.</p>
<p>These images and annotations are for training deep learning models to identify different constituents in leaves, almond buds, and soil aggregates</p>
<p>Limitations:<br />
For the walnut leaves, some tissues (stomata, etc.) are not labeled and only represent a small portion of a full leaf. Similarly, both the almond bud and the aggregate represent just one single sample of each. The bud tissues are only divided up into buds scales, flower, and air space. Many other tissues remain unlabeled. For the soil aggregate annotated labels are done by eye with no actual chemical information. Therefore particulate organic matter identification may be incorrect.</p>

Yield Editor 2.0.7,"<p>Yield Editor is a tool which allows the user to select, apply and analyze a variety of automated filters and editing techniques used to process and clean yield data.  The software imports either AgLeader advanced or Greenstar text file formats, and exports data in a delimited ASCII format.</p>
<p>Yield Editor 2.0.7 includes some of the improvements and updates that users of the software have asked to be included.  It provides three major improvements over version 1.0.2.  The most important of these is the inclusion of a module for automated selection of many yield filter values, as well as a couple of additional automated filter types.  A legend tool has been added which allows for the viewing of multiple data streams. Finally, a command line interface language under development allows for automated batch mode processing of large yield datasets.</p>
<p>Yield maps provide important information for developing and evaluating precision management strategies. The high-quality yield maps needed for decision-making require screening raw yield monitor datasets for errors and removing them before maps are made. To facilitate this process, we developed the Yield Editor interactive software which has been widely used by producers, consultants and researchers. Some of the most difficult and time consuming issues involved in cleaning yield maps include determination of combine delay times, and the removal of “overlapped” data, especially near end rows. Our new Yield Editor 2.0 automates these and other tasks, significantly increasing the reliability and reducing the difficulty of creating accurate yield maps. This paper describes this new software, with emphasis on the Automated Yield Cleaning Expert (AYCE) module. Application of Yield Editor 2.0 is illustrated through comparison of automated AYCE cleaning to the interactive approach available in Yield Editor 1.x. On a test set of fifty grain yield maps, AYCE cleaning was not significantly different than interactive cleaning by an expert user when examining field mean yield, yield standard deviation, and number of yield observations remaining after cleaning. Yield Editor 2.0 provides greatly improved efficiency and equivalent accuracy compared to the interactive methods available in Yield Editor 1.x.</p>

iSnobal,"<p>iSnobal is a physically-based distributed snowmelt model. Snowmelt is the principal source for soil moisture, ground-water re-charge, and stream-flow in mountainous regions of the western US, Canada, and other similar regions of the world. Information on the timing, magnitude, and contributing area of melt under variable or changing climate conditions is required for successful water and resource management. A coupled energy and mass-balance model iSnobal is used to simulate the development and melting of the seasonal snowcover in several mountain basins in California, Idaho, and Utah. Simulations are done over basins varying from 1 to 2500 km2 , with simulation periods varying from a few days for the smallest basin, Emerald Lake watershed in California, to multiple snow seasons for the Park City area in Utah. The model is driven by topographically corrected estimates of radiation, temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation. Simulation results in all basins closely match independently measured snow water equivalent, snow depth, or runoff during both the development and depletion of the snowcover. Spatially distributed estimates of snow deposition and melt allow us to better understand the interaction between topographic structure, climate, and moisture availability in mountain basins of the western US. Application of topographically distributed models such as this will lead to improved water resource and watershed management.</p>

Livestock and Meat Marketing Study,"GIPSA Livestock and Meat Marketing Study Final Reports (February 2007).
In fiscal year 2003, GIPSA received $4.5 million in appropriations to study marketing practices in the whole livestock and red meat industry.  In June 2004, at the end of a competitive bidding process, GIPSA awarded a $4.3 million contract to the RTI International (RTI) to conduct the study. RTI delivered an interim report in July 2005.  The interim report described alternative marketing arrangements (AMAs), common terms in AMAs, and why industry participants used them. In February 2007, GIPSA released the final report.  The final report included results from RTI’s analysis of the extent of use, price relationships, and costs and benefits of AMAs.",Packers and Stockyards Programs,Irene Omade,mailto:m.irene.omade@usda.gov,2015-05-27,http://www.gipsa.usda.gov/psp/publication/live_meat_market.aspx,text/html,public

Milk Marketing Order Statistics,"The statistical data generated through the administration of the Federal milk order program is recognized widely as one of the benefits of this program. These data provide comprehensive and accurate information on milk supplies, utilization, and sales, as well as class prices established under the orders and prices paid to dairy farmers (producers). The sources of this data are monthly reports of receipts and utilization, producer payroll reports, and reports of nonpool handlers filed by milk processors (handlers) subject to the provisions of the various milk orders. The local market administrator (MA) uses these reports to determine pool obligations under the order and to verify proper payments to producers. Auditors employed by the MA review handler records to assure the accuracy of reported information. Reporting errors are corrected; if necessary, pool obligations are revised.

After the pool obligations have been determined the local market administrator summarizes the individual handler reports and submits a series of order summary reports to the Market Information Branch (MIB) in Dairy Programs. The MIB summarizes the individual order data and disseminates this information via monthly, bimonthly, and annual releases or publications. Since milk marketing order statistics are based on reports filed by the population of possible reporting firms and not a sample, these statistics are comprehensive. Also, since these individual firm reports are subject to audit and verification, these statistics are accurate.

The Federal milk order statistics database contains historical information, beginning in January 2000, generated by the administration of the Federal milk order program. Most of the information in the database has been published previously by the Market Information Branch in Dairy Programs either on its web site or in the Dairy Market News Report. New users are encouraged to use the ""User Guide"" to learn how to navigate the search screens.  If you are interested in a description of the Federal milk order statistics program, or want current data, in ready made table form, use the ""Current Information"" link.","Agricultural Marketing Service, Department of Agriculture",Sarah Buikemah,mailto:sarah.buikema@ams.usda.gov,2014-02-26,http://apps.ams.usda.gov/USDAMIB/Main/Welcome.aspx,text/html,public

DAFO manages these boundaries and they change as office closures and resource changes occur. Such a layer could be created, but the updated information must be received before a boundary file can be created. If a geographic boundary file were to be created, FSA would have to organize a regular cycle when DAFO provides updated information as changes occur, establish a process for creating that geospatial boundary layer, and determine where and how FSA would host this and make it accessible for the future.  With the exception of NAIP imagery, none of the other geospatial layers are publicly releasable data.

U.S. General Soil Map (STATSGO2) for Individual States,"This dataset consists of general soil association units. It was developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey and supersedes the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) dataset published in 1994. It consists of a broad based inventory of soils and nonsoil areas that occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped of 1:250,000 in the continental U.S., Hawaii, Puerto, and the Virgin Islands and 1:1,000,000 in Alaska. The dataset was created by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Where more detailed soil survey maps were not available, data on geology, topography, vegetation,
and climate were assembled, together with Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images. Soils of like areas were studied, and the probable classification and extent of the soils were determined.

Map unit composition was determined by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize the entire map unit.

This dataset consists of georeferenced vector digital data and tabular digital data. The map data were collected in 1- by 2-degree topographic quadrangle units. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.

These data provide information about soil features on or near the surface of the Earth. Data were collected as part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey. These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the state, regional, and national level. The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:250,000-scale data.",NRCS,Eva Mitter,mailto:eva.mitter@wdc.usda.gov,2006-07-06,http://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov,text/html,public

This technical report presents the most recent estimates for married- couple and single-parent families using data from the 2011-15 Consumer Expenditure Survey (all data presented in 2015 dollars). Data and methods used in calculating annual child-rearing expenses are described. Estimates are provided for married-couple and single-parent families with two children for major components of the budget by age of child, family income, and region of residence. For the overall United States, annual child-rearing expense estimates ranged between $12,350 and $13,900 for a child in a two-child, married-couple family in the middle-income group. Adjustment factors for households with less than or greater than two children are also provided. Expenses vary considerably by household income level, region, and composition, emphasizing that a single estimate may not be  applicable to all families. Results of this study may be of use in developing State child support and foster care guidelines, as well as public health and family-centered educational programs.

Measuring the Effect of SNAP Participation on Food Security,"SNAP is designed to reduce food insecurity – reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns in a household due to lack of money or other resources – but data quantifying this effect is limited. The objectives of this study were to: Assess how food security and food expenditures vary with SNAP participation. Examine how relationships between SNAP and food security and between SNAP and food expenditures vary by household characteristics and circumstances. Estimating the effect of SNAP on food insecurity using household survey data is challenging because households that choose to participate in SNAP can differ in systematic ways from households that do not participate, making it hard to distinguish the impact of SNAP from these other factors. This study sought to control for the SNAP participation “selection bias” by comparing information collected from households within days of entering the program (new entrants) to information obtained after about 6 months of participation.",Food and Nutrition Service,FNS Webmaster,mailto:webmaster@fns.usda.gov,2013-08-16,http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/Measuring2013.pdf,application/pdf,public

"Summer Food Service Participation, Meals, and Costs Data","During the school year, many children receive free and reduced-price breakfast and lunch through the School Breakfast and National School Lunch Programs. What happens when school lets out? Hunger is one of the most severe roadblocks to the learning process. Lack of nutrition during the summer months may set up a cycle for poor performance once school begins again. Hunger also may make children more prone to illness and other health issues. The Summer Food Service Program is designed to fill that nutrition gap and make sure children can get the nutritious meals they need.  This data set contains information on summer food service participation, meals served and cash payments provided by state.","Food and Nutrition Service, Department of Agriculture",Tim Kreh,mailto:Tim.Kreh@fns.usda.gov,2014-12-23,http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/pd/sfsummar.xls,application/vnd.ms-excel,public

Aerial Fire Retardant Avoidance Areas: Terrestrial (Feature Layer),"This layer contains features of aerial fire retardant avoidance areas delivered as part of the 2011 Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land Environmental Impact Statement. This Feature Class shows areas, provided by each National Forest who used aerial fire retardant from 2000-2010, where the aerial application of fire retardant should be avoided in order to prevent the potential of impacts to Federally listed threatened or endangered species as identified through consultation, or Forest Service sensitive species. Data includes location of terrestrial and hydrographic areas where the application of aerial fire retardant is to be avoided. Current aerial fire retardant standards prohibit application within 300 feet of hydrographic features. Therefore, this data may contain duplicate hydrographic areas already covered by existing standards. This data is to be used in planning and implementation phases of USFS fire activities to help prevent misapplication of aerial fire retardant in known areas of TES species or water features throughout National Forest lands. Provided here is a National merged dataset derived from each National Forest contribution. This data has been merged, dissolved, and erased of attributes contained in each original component dataset. For this purpose, specific attributes are not necessary, as any spatial areas depicted simply show areas where aerial fire retardant use is to be avoided as stated in USFS guidelines. <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.AerialFireRetardantAvoidance.xml' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>Metadata</a>",U.S. Forest Service,USFSEnterpriseContent,mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov,2023-12-29,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/36450fe86e484542b2efab4518217c58/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139,dcat:Distribution,public
Aerial Fire Retardant Hydrographic Avoidance Areas: Aquatic (Map Service),"Aerial retardant avoidance area for hydrographic feature data are based on high resolution National Hydrographic Dataset (NHD) produced by USGS and available from the USFS. Forests and/or regions have had the opportunity to modify the default NHD water representation (300ft buffer from all water features) for their areas of interest to accurately represent aerial fire retardant avoidance areas as described in the 2011 Record of Decision for the Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land EIS. These changes have been integrated into this dataset depicting aerial fire retardant avoidance areas for hydrographic features. The following process was used to develop the hydrographic areas to be avoided by aerial fire retardant. Initially, all intermittent/ephemeral and perennial features were buffered by 300 feet by the Forest/Region units. Subsequently, Forest/Region units may have extended these buffers locally based on their requirements. There may be overlapping features that have been created during the buffering process, so one must dissolve features before calculating any area values. Data is symbolized by FCODE. Using the FCODE attribute, streams/rivers/waterbodies are categorized into perennial and intermittent/ephemeral types. Avoidance features (streams and rivers) with FCODES 46003 and 46007, as well as features (lakes and other waterbody) with FCODES 39001, 39005, 39006, 43614, 46601 are considered intermittent/ephemeral features. All other FCODES are considered to be perennial features. All underground and covered water features (e.g., pipelines) are excluded. When symbolizing this information, perennial features should be drawn on top of intermittent/ephemeral features to give the proper message. Data displays at scales larger than 1:1,250,000. Data uses a Web Mercator projection. The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee. <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/datasets.php?xmlKeyword=Aerial+Fire+Retardant+Hydrographic+Avoidance+Areas' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>Metadata and Downloads</a>",U.S. Forest Service,USFSEnterpriseContent,mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov,2022-08-29,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/4e6b0400575340d189aa6344c99026b4/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139,dcat:Distribution,public

"Beaver monitoring data from the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, Wisconsin","The primary raw data are aerial counts of beaver (Castor canadensis) colonies on streams across the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest (CNNF). These aerial counts were performed in the fall of each year from 1987 (Nicolet side of CNNF) or 1997 (Chequamegon side of CNNF). Based on the colony counts, we also provide derived beaver colony density values. The surveyed streams were classified into four categories: managed trout, non-managed trout, managed non-trout, and non-managed non-trout.

Data and source code for A Bayesian model to correct underestimated 3D wind speeds from sonic anemometers increases turbulent components of the surface energy balance,"Sonic anemometers are the principal instruments in micrometeorological studies of turbulence and ecosystem fluxes. Common designs underestimate vertical wind measurements because they lack a correction for transducer shadowing, with no consensus on a suitable correction. We present a subset of data collected during field experiments in 2011 and 2013 featuring two or four CSAT3 sonic anemometers. We introduce a Bayesian analysis to resolve the three-dimensional correction by optimizing differences between anemometers mounted both vertically and horizontally. A grid of 512 points (~ �5�resolution in wind location) is defined on a sphere around the sonic anemometer, from which the shadow correction for each transducer-pair is derived from a set of 138 unique state variables describing the quadrants and borders. Using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, the Bayesian model proposes new values for each state variable, recalculates the fast-response dataset, summarizes the five-minute wind statistics, and accepts the proposed new values based on the probability that they make measurements from vertical and horizontal anemometers more equivalent. MCMC chains were constructed for three different prior distributions describing the state variables: no shadow correction, the Kaimal correction for transducer shadowing, and double the Kaimal correction, all initialized with 10% uncertainty. This archive includes all data and source code required to create the 3-D posterior correction and to analyze its effect during the 2011 and 2013 field experiments plus a 2016 field validation experiment. There are 20 Hz wind velocity and temperature data from the 2011 and 2013 field experiments contained within 74,664 files (one file each per five-minute period, replicate anemometer, and separated between wind and temperature) and 20 Hz wind velocity and temperature data from the 2016 experiment contained within 1883 files (one file each per each five-minute period, each file contains 3 replicate anemometers). R code is provided to estimate the posterior correction from the 2011 and 2013 wind data using Bayesian analysis assuming three prior corrections: a flat prior, the Kaimal correction, and double the Kaimal correction. Matlab code is provided to normalize, thin, and scale the posterior correction into its final form. Matlab code is provided to apply the posterior correction and to analyze is effect for both sets of data. Auxiliary files to execute the code are also provided.",U.S. Forest Service,USFSEnterpriseContent,mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov,2022-08-25,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/a7f5500725024340b188066be3ed608d/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139,dcat:Distribution,public

Each raster represents the monthly hazard of a wildfire occurring within a 30 meter pixel as a probability. A statistical model for each month was parameterized with an integrated moisture index, a cumulative drought severity index for the month during the period 2000 to 2009, percent forest cover, and wildland-urban interface classifications to predict the probability of wildfire occurrence based on reported wildfires. Each model included 10 iterations and the raster products of average, minimum, maximum, median, and standard deviation of the predicted probability of a wildfire occurrence is provided. All raster values were converted to integers by multiplying by 10 to reduce file sizes.

Expected change in suitable habitat for riparian species along the Rio Grande in New Mexico under changing climate,"Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt 3.3.3) methods were used to estimate expected change in suitable habitat for 12 different wildlife species under changing climate along the Rio Grande in New Mexico. Species include: Lucy's warbler, southwestern willow flycatcher, western yellow-billed cuckoo, New Mexican meadow jumping mouse, Hispid cotton rat, long-legged bat, Occult bat, Yuma bat, black-necked gartersnake, western painted turtle, american bullfrog, and northern leopard frog. These species were selected because their distribution is tied to a habitat or feature characteristic important to multiple species. Models of suitable habitat for each species are based on observation data from collection and survey samples taken from 1970 through 2013. MaxEnt related species' presence to climate, biophysical, and vegetation characteristics. We then projected future suitability of habitats by applying these models to future conditions as predicted by three climate models at three times periods, 2030 (2020-2060), 2060 (2050-2070), and 2090 (2080-2100). The climate data used in this study were derived from the: 1) Canadian Center for Climate Modeling and analysis (CCC) using the CGCM3.1 model, 2) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics laboratory (GFDL) using the CM2.1 model and, 3) Met office, Hadley Centre (HAD), using the HadCM3 model.

"Final spatial and tabular data from a process-based model (3-PG) used to predict and map hybrid poplar biomass productivity in Minnesota and Wisconsin, USA","Hybrid poplars have demonstrated high biomass productivity in the North Central USA as short rotation woody crops (SRWCs). However, our ability to quantitatively predict productivity for sites that are not currently in SRWCs is limited. In this study, the Physiological Processes Predicting Growth (3-PG) model was (1) assigned parameters for hybrid poplars using species-specific physiological data and allometric relationships from previously published studies, (2) calibrated for the North Central region using previously-published biomass data from eight plantations along with site-specific climate and soils data, (3) validated against previously published biomass data from four other plantations using linear regression of actual versus predicted total aboveground dry biomass, (4) evaluated for sensitivity of the model to manipulation of the parameter for age at full canopy cover (fullCanAge) and the fertility rating growth modifier, and (5) combined with soil and climate data layers to produce a map of predicted biomass productivity for the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin. This package contains the polygon feature layer and tabular data that correspond to 'Using a process-based model (3-PG) to predict and map hybrid poplar biomass productivity in Minnesota and Wisconsin, USA.' (Headlee et al. 2013). The tabular data for mean annual biomass for hybrid poplar including the STATSGO soil and NARR climate values were used to generate the biomass values.

Forest Inventory and Analysis Database,"The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) research program has been in existence since mandated by Congress in 1928. FIA's primary objective is to determine the extent, condition, volume, growth, and depletion of timber on the Nation's forest land. Before 1999, all inventories were conducted on a periodic basis. The passage of the 1998 Farm Bill requires FIA to collect data annually on plots within each State. This kind of up-to-date information is essential to frame realistic forest policies and programs. Summary reports for individual States are published but the Forest Service also provides data collected in each inventory to those interested in further analysis. Data is distributed via the FIA DataMart in a standard format. This standard format, referred to as the Forest Inventory and Analysis Database (FIADB) structure, was developed to provide users with as much data as possible in a consistent manner among States. A number of inventories conducted prior to the implementation of the annual inventory are available in the FIADB. However, various data attributes may be empty or the items may have been collected or computed differently.

Forest Stewardship Program Federal Investment Areas (Image Service),"With the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (the 2008 Farm Bill), Congress tasked states and territories to craft assessments of the forests within their boundaries and develop strategies to address threats and forest management opportunities. Now known as Forest Action Plans, these assessments and strategies provide an analysis of forest conditions and trends in the state and delineate priority forest landscape areas. They offer long-term plans for investing state, federal, and other resources where they can be most effective in achieving national conservation goals by addressing the State and Private Forestry (SPF) national priorities and objectives: 1) Conserve working forest lands, 2) Protect forests from harm, and 3) Enhance public benefits from trees and forests. Administered by the US Forest Service and implemented by State forestry agencies, the SPF Forest Stewardship Program encourages private forest landowners to manage their lands using professionally prepared Forest Stewardship plans. Participation in the Forest Stewardship Program requires that states and territories submit a raster dataset of priority areas specific to the Program - aligned with priority landscapes identified in Forest Action Plans - called Forest Stewardship Program Federal Investment Areas, where they will focus their Program delivery efforts. Program performance measures include acres covered by active Forest Stewardship plans that are within Forest Stewardship Priority Areas.",U.S. Forest Service,USFSEnterpriseContent,mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov,2023-08-03,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/563e40087f2647f384e67efa03f59fc9/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139,dcat:Distribution,public

GAOA Project Summary (Feature Layer),"<span style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:14.4px;'>This dataset displays the approximate location of US Forest Service, Great American Outdoors Act (GAOA) projects. The data is refreshed on a nightly basis from the US Forest Service database of infrastructure projects which is stewarded by the individual National Forests and Grasslands. This dataset is a spatial data layer of points representing the approximate or general location where the project takes place. The point location is intended for use in small scale maps to indicate the general location of the projects across the country. The location data is maintained by staff on the individual National Forest or Grassland using the database of record. Because a project can be made up of many assets distributed across a land area, a single project location point will not always reflect the specific location and extent of the work in the project. The project detail data can be used to display the individual assets that make up the project.

Great Basin Montane Watersheds - Furthest Head (Feature Layer),"Multiple research and management partners collaboratively developed a multiscale approach for assessing the geomorphic sensitivity of streams and ecological resilience of riparian and meadow ecosystems in upland watersheds of the Great Basin to disturbances and management actions. The approach builds on long-term work by the partners on the responses of these systems to disturbances and management actions. At the core of the assessments is information on past and present watershed and stream channel characteristics, geomorphic and hydrologic processes, and riparian and meadow vegetation. In this report, we describe the approach used to delineate Great Basin mountain ranges and the watersheds within them, and the data that are available for the individual watersheds. We also describe the resulting database and the data sources. Furthermore, we summarize information on the characteristics of the regions and watersheds within the regions and the implications of the assessments for geomorphic sensitivity and ecological resilience. The target audience for this multiscale approach is managers and stakeholders interested in assessing and adaptively managing Great Basin stream systems and riparian and meadow ecosystems.

Great Basin Montane Watersheds - Streams (Feature Layer),"Multiple research and management partners collaboratively developed a multiscale approach for assessing the geomorphic sensitivity of streams and ecological resilience of riparian and meadow ecosystems in upland watersheds of the Great Basin to disturbances and management actions. The approach builds on long-term work by the partners on the responses of these systems to disturbances and management actions. At the core of the assessments is information on past and present watershed and stream channel characteristics, geomorphic and hydrologic processes, and riparian and meadow vegetation. In this report, we describe the approach used to delineate Great Basin mountain ranges and the watersheds within them, and the data that are available for the individual watersheds. We also describe the resulting database and the data sources. Furthermore, we summarize information on the characteristics of the regions and watersheds within the regions and the implications of the assessments for geomorphic sensitivity and ecological resilience. The target audience for this multiscale approach is managers and stakeholders interested in assessing and adaptively managing Great Basin stream systems and riparian and meadow ecosystems.

Hazardous Fuel Treatment Reduction: Line (Feature Layer),"The Forest Service's Natural Resource Manager (NRM) Forest Activity Tracking System (FACTS) is the agency standard for managing information about activities related to fire/fuels, silviculture, and invasive species. FACTS is an activity tracking application for all levels of the Forest Service. The application allows tracking and monitoring of NEPA decisions as well as the ability to create and manage KV trust fund plans at the timber sale level. This application complements its companion NRM applications, which cover the spectrum of living and non-living natural resource information. This layer represents activities of hazardous fuel treatment reduction that are polygons. All accomplishments toward the unified hazardous fuels reduction target must meet the following definition: Vegetative manipulation designed to create and maintain resilient and sustainable landscapes, including burning, mechanical treatments, and/or other methods that reduce the quantity or change the arrangement of living or dead fuel so that the intensity, severity, or effects of wildland fire are reduced within acceptable ecological parameters and consistent with land management plan objectives, or activities that maintain desired fuel conditions. These conditions should be measurable or predictable using fire behavior prediction models or fire effects models. <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.Activity_HazFuelTrt_LN.xml' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>Metadata</a>",U.S. Forest Service,USFSEnterpriseContent,mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov,2023-12-29,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/d5024b69878446d9becc322c1991981f/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139,dcat:Distribution,public

Holt Research Forest regeneration data,"This data publication contains regeneration data collected at the Holt Research Forest (HRF) in Maine between 1984 and 2010. The study area is comprised of 40 hectares divided into 1 hectare blocks (4-0.25 hectare quadrats), the western half where forest management (group selection harvest in 1987/1988 on 10 of 20 hectares) is practiced and the eastern half where no manipulations are allowed. There are three different types of regeneration plots inventoried periodically to evaluate the status of regeneration from seedling to sapling size over a large portion of the study area. Four square meter (4 m) subplots are designed to assess tree regeneration at the scale of seedlings and saplings &lt; 1.5 centimeters diameter at breast height (DBH). The number found in various height classes by species are provided for 1984, 1992, 1997, 2004, and 2009. The 25 square meter (25 m) plots are designed to assess tree regeneration in response to forest canopy gaps (harvest, ledge, and tree gaps) versus intact canopy. These data include the number of saplings counted in size classes (0.5 meters tall to 9.49 centimeters DBH) by species, along with an assessment of damage in 1997, 2002, and 2010. Thirdly, the 200 square meter (200 m) plots are designed to assess tree regeneration at the scale of saplings 1.5-9.49 centimeters DBH. For these plots the number of saplings counted in 1 centimeter DBH classes by species are provided along with an assessment of condition (not all years) in 1984, 1992, 1997, 2004, and 2009.",U.S. Forest Service,USFSEnterpriseContent,mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov,2022-08-29,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/d7ef873aeb3140a88e4f24edd5a2fbc2/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139,dcat:Distribution,public

Kings River Experimental Watersheds stream discharge,"The Kings River Experimental Watersheds (KREW) project is a long term forest management study that began in the early 2000's. The KREW project is comprised of eight primary headwater catchments of the Kings River Basin within the Sierra National Forest, California. Two additional catchments (P300 and B200) were added in 2005 and 2006. The ten catchments are clustered into two groups, Providence and Bull. Providence catchments (P300, P301, P303, P304, and D102) ranged in size from 49 to 461 hectares, and had mean elevations ranging from 1,782 to 1,979 meters. Bull catchments (B200, B201, B203, B204, and T003) ranged in size from 53 to 474 hectares, and had mean elevations ranging from 2,122 to 2,373 meters. All catchments, except T003, had a dominant southwest aspect, whereas T003 faced primarily southeast.

The Knutson-Vandenberg Act (K-V) of June 9, 1930 (16 U.S.C. 576-576b; 46 Stat. 527), as amended by the National Forest Management Act of October 22, 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1600 et seq.) authorized collection of deposits from federal timber purchasers for prompt and efficient use of funds to reestablish, protect, and improve the production of renewable resources on timber sale areas. This includes performing soil improvement and watershed restoration, wildlife habitat improvement, control of insects, disease, and noxious weeds, tree planting, seeding and other cultural treatments necessary to maintain and improve land productivity. Since its creation millions of acres of National Forest System lands (NFS) have been treated and restored to resilient conditions and terrestrial and aquatic habitat improved. Public Law 109-54 of August 2, 2005, Title IV General Provisions, Sec 412 further amended the K-V Act to allow the collection and use of CWKV funds for watershed restoration, wildlife habitat improvement, to prepare timber sales, control of insects, disease, and noxious weeds, fire community protection activities, and the maintenance of forest roads within the Forest Service region in which the timber sale occurred. Provided that such activities may be performed through the use of contracts, forest product sales, and cooperative agreements. Note that these activities are to be performed by contract and not Forest Service personnel. The Forest Service used this amendment to administratively create two K-V programs within the K-V fund; CWKV (Cooperative Work, Knutson-Vandenberg, Sale Area Projects) and CWK2 (Cooperative Work, Knutson-Vandenberg, Regional Projects). This layer shows the spatial representation where activities accomplished and funded with CWKV and CWK2 funds and reported through the Forest Service Activity Tracking System (FACTS) database. It is important to note that this layer may not contain all CWKV or CWK2 accomplished activities; the spatial portion of the activity description is not currently enforced by FACTS and at this time some are optionally reported by Forest Service units. As spatial data reporting is enforced by the application and acceptant of reporting both tabular and spatial we hope to improve the quality and comprehensiveness of the data used for this layer in coming years. <a href='https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.Activity_KnutsonVandenberg.xml' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>Metadata</a>",U.S. Forest Service,USFSEnterpriseContent,mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov,2022-08-29,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/f7dafcc811204aeeb3712b753851cbdd/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139,dcat:Distribution,public

LCMS is a remote sensing-based system for mapping and monitoring landscape change across the United States. Its objective is to develop a consistent approach using the latest technology and advancements in change detection to produce a 'best available' map of landscape change. Because no algorithm performs best in all situations, LCMS uses an ensemble of models as predictors, which improves map accuracy across a range of ecosystems and change processes (Healey et al., 2018). The resulting suite of LCMS change, land cover, and land use maps offer a holistic depiction of landscape change across the United States over the past four decades.

The annual medoid is then computed to summarize each year into a single composite. The composite time series is temporally segmented using LandTrendr (Kennedy et al., 2010; Kennedy et al., 2018; Cohen et al., 2018). All cloud and cloud shadow free values are also temporally segmented using the CCDC algorithm (Zhu and Woodcock, 2014).

Reference data are collected using TimeSync, a web-based tool that helps analysts visualize and interpret the Landsat data record from 1984-present (Cohen et al., 2010).Outputs fall into three categories: change, land cover, and land use.

Long-term site responses to season and interval of underburns on the Georgia Piedmont,"Between 1987 and 1988, twenty-four approximately 2-acre plots were established in Jones County, Georgia on the Hitchiti Experimental Forest which is also known as the Brender Demonstration Forest. These plots have not burned since prior to 1939. Treatments were applied to track site changes over time from five short return interval underburn treatments. These treatments, replicated 4 times, were comprised of: biennial dormant season headfires, triennial dormant season headfires, triennial dormant season backfires, triennial growing season headfires, growing season headfires every 6 years, and unburned controls. Triennial dormant season treatments were eventually combined. Variables tracked over time include the impact of fire on overstory pine growth, midstory (in this study midstory includes understory plants &gt; 4.5 feet high) structure and composition, seedling (in this study including all woody plants &lt; 4.5 feet high and all other plants regardless of height) species dominance, percent cover, pine seedling establishment and mortality, and forest floor consumption. Several thousand overstory and midstory trees were tagged, GPS coordinates recorded and their survival and growth followed over time. Vegetation was measured in nested circular plots and on line transects. Live and dead overstory trees on two 0.2 acre (1/5 ac) subplots per treatment plot were tallied annually by species with diameter at breast height and height, measured and pest damage/mortality by pathogen, lightning and wind damage recorded. Basal area was calculated periodically. Some overstory pines were bored to determine age (typically after death). Midstory live and dead trees were tallied annually on six 0.02 acre subplots per treatment plot. Seedlings were tallied on eighteen 0.001 acre (MA = milacre) subplots per treatment plot by species/species group, and percent of the subplot area in vines, herbs, moss, live woody material, dead plant material, and void of plant material (exposed mineral soil). Six 33 feet line transects per treatment plot were divided into 6 inch segments and dominant seedling species/species group tallied annually. Over 150 species/species groups were identified and tracked over time. Weights of likely available live fuel were determined by species/species group prior to each burn, as were weights of likely available dead fuel for various categories/size classes. Paired postburn samples were collected to determine consumption of various fuel categories. Overstory and midstory pine crown scorch, foliage consumption, and hardwood mortality were tallied within two weeks following each burn. Other vegetation datasets include pine seedling establishment and survival over time on the 18 MA subplots per treatment plot. Red cockaded woodpecker (RCW) related information was collected annually by Region 8 (Southern Region) of the USFS and is available from them. Live and dead fuel moisture data were sampled prior to every burn and can include preburn moisture content grab samples, 10-hour fuel stick readings, and random lumber probe readings. Fire behavior records of headfires and backfires can include rate of spread, flame length, flame angle, flame zone depth, short distance spotting, slopovers, burnout time, and percent of plot burned. The study plan called for observations of fire residence time as well, but such observations were rarely recorded. Weather data include on-plot hand-held instrument observations of surface wind velocity, ambient temperature and relative humidity (RH). On-site data collected can include precipitation, ambient temperature, RH and wind traces from recording gauges. Keetch Byram Drought Index (KBDI) calculation and National Fire danger Rating System NFDRS predictions and other weather observations taken at two nearby Georgia Forestry Commission weather stations were also included.",U.S. Forest Service,USFSEnterpriseContent,mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov,2022-08-25,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/05e7b05a038041678748b0d66ca7c8ca/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139,dcat:Distribution,public

MODIS-based annual production estimates from 2000-2015 for rangelands in USFS grazing allotments in Region 5,"This data publication contains an ESRI grid dataset describing annual productivity and drought in the non-forest domain of Region 5 (California) of the United States Forest Service (USFS). Production data were generated from the Rangeland Vegetation Simulator (RVS). This program uses Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from 2000-2015 at 250 square meter resolution to estimate production. NDVI is converted to production estimates using vegetation specific coefficients in the Rangeland Vegetation Simulator (RVS). In addition to annual production data (offered in pounds per acre), this ESRI grid dataset also provides an annual summation of drought data from the USDA drought monitor for aiding interpretation of annual production data. Both the production and drought data are offered from 2000-2015. In addition, basic relationships, such as correlation coefficients, between drought and productivity are offered so that the analyst can find anomalies in allotments where production is not matching temporal patterns of drought. The RVS was applied to allotments of Region 5 of the USFS. The allotment data were spatially combined with CalVeg (Classification and Assessment with Landsat of Visible Ecological Groupings) (a polygon based description of vegetation types for California and more information can be found at: https://www.fs.usda.gov/r5/rsl/projects/classification/system.shtml) layer to produce 4035 unique combinations of vegetation attributes and allotments. The vegetation classification used to do this combination was the Society for Range Management (SRM) cover type. There were 23 vegetation types considered to represent non-forested vegetation in the SRM classification found across the grazing allotments. The time period of analysis for this assessment across which production estimates were developed was also 2000-2015.",U.S. Forest Service,USFSEnterpriseContent,mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov,2022-08-25,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/26235d2b8df64dddad6009520653d6a4/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139,dcat:Distribution,public

Missoula Fire Lab Emission Inventory (MFLEI) for CONUS,"The Missoula Fire Lab Emission Inventory (MFLEI) is a retrospective, daily wildfire emission inventory for the contiguous United States with a spatial resolution of 250 meters (m). MFLEI was produced using multiple datasets of fire activity and burned area, a newly developed wildland fuels map and an updated emission factor database. This data publication contains the 2003-2015 MFLEI estimates of daily fuel consumed and emissions of CO2, CO, CH4, and PM2.5 at 250 m spatial resolution. The inventory also includes carefully constructed uncertainty estimates for daily fuel consumption and emissions at 250 m spatial resolution. The dataset includes daily emissions and uncertainties aggregated to 10 kilometer (km) � 10 km grid. The aggregated product provides area burned, mass of fuel consumed, and emissions of CO2, CO, CH4, and PM2.5. The emission and emission uncertainty data are provided as comma-delimited ASCII text files. MFLEI fuel consumption and land cover type may be combined with published emission factor datasets to estimate emissions for hundreds of volatile organic compounds and other pollutants present in fresh wildfire smoke. This data publication contains geospatial data in raster format and tabular data. The raster datasets includes a map of the coefficient of variation of the herbaceous fuel loading, a land cover map of herbaceous, shrub, and forest type groups (FIA), and maps of the upper bound, lower bound, and best estimate of herbaceous or shrub fuel loading.",U.S. Forest Service,USFSEnterpriseContent,mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov,2022-08-25,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/991f41f7b5854c15bc986b81284f8eb8/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139,dcat:Distribution,public
Monarch Butterfly Habitat Restoration: Polygon (Feature Layer),"Activities meeting the Monarch Butterfly Habitat Restoration initiative are a subset of activities that benefit native plants, and in doing so, benefit pollinators. Activities such as thinning, prescribed fire and other methods of fuel removal, treating invasive species and acres of native plantings can benefit Monarchs. Activities are self-reported by Forest Service Units and are reported when completed. This layer does not contain all activities that benefit Monarchs because this is a relatively new requirement for the program.

NLCD 2011-2016 Tree Canopy Cover Change CONUS (Image Service),"The USDA Forest Service (USFS) builds multiple versions of percent tree canopy cover data, in order to serve needs of multiple user communities. These datasets encompass CONUS, Coastal Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. There are three versions of data within the 2016 TCC Product Suite, which include: The initial model outputs referred to as the Analytical data; A masked version of the initial output referred to as Cartographic data; And a modified version built for the National Land Cover Database and referred to as NLCD data, which includes a canopy cover change dataset derived from subtraction of datasets for the nominal years of 2011 and 2016.The Analytical data are the initial model outputs generated in the production workflow. These data are best suited for users who will carry out their own detailed statistical and uncertainty analyses on the dataset and place lower priority on the visual appearance of the dataset for cartographic purposes. Datasets for the nominal years of 2011 and 2016 are available. The Cartographic products mask the initial model outputs to improve the visual appearance of the datasets. These data are best suited for users who prioritize visual appearance of the data for cartographic and illustrative purposes. Datasets for the nominal years of 2011 and 2016 are available. The NLCD data are the result of further processing of the masked data. The goal was to generate three coordinated components. The components are (1) a dataset for the nominal year of 2011, (2) a dataset for the nominal year of 2016, and (3) a dataset that captures the change in canopy cover between the two nominal years of 2011 and 2016.

This data publication contains a spatial database of wildfires that occurred in the United States from 1992 to 2018. It is the fourth update of a publication originally generated to support the national Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system. The wildfire records were acquired from the reporting systems of federal, state, and local fire organizations. The following core data elements were required for records to be included in this data publication: discovery date, final fire size, and a point location at least as precise as a Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section (1-square mile grid). The data were transformed to conform, when possible, to the data standards of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG), including an updated wildfire-cause standard (approved August 2020). Basic error-checking was performed and redundant records were identified and removed, to the degree possible. In addition to incorporating data for 2016-2018, some previously unavailable nonfederal wildfire records for the period 1999-2015 were acquired either directly from the state fire services (NH, NJ) or indirectly from an updated National Association of State Foresters database (AR, AZ, CA, CO, FL, HI, ID, IL, OK, SD) and added. The resulting product, referred to as the Fire Program Analysis fire-occurrence database (FPA FOD), includes 2.17 million geo-referenced wildfire records, representing a total of 165 million acres burned during the 27-year period. Identifiers necessary to link the point-based, final-fire-reporting information to published large-fire-perimeter and operational-situation-reporting datasets are included. <div><br /></div><div><a href='https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/Catalog/RDS-2013-0009.5' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>Additional Information</a><br /></div>",U.S. Forest Service,USFSEnterpriseContent,mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov,2023-03-29,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/c02f500b5a6d47e3b7320f1b34399c84/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139,dcat:Distribution,public

National Snag Hazard (Image Service),"<div style='text-align:Left;'><div><p><span>Snags continue to pose an ever-present hazard to responders, and recent increases in fire activity have resulted in an accumulation of these hazards across forested landscapes of the American West. National Snag Hazard is intended to provide a landscape-level view of existing snag hazard to firefighters and other field going employees. National Snag hazard is based on estimated density and median height of snags greater than or equal to 7.9 inches in diameter at breast height. Snag density and median snag height are classified into hazard levels using the breakpoints from Dunn et al. 2019, which are based on the logic that hazard increases with snag density and height.       Dunn CJ, O’Connor CD, Reilly MJ, Calkin DE, Thompson MP (2019) Spatial and temporal assessment of responder exposure to snag hazards in post-fire environments. Forest Ecology and Management 441, 202-2014. DOI:10.1016/j.foreco.2019.03.035       This is a strategic landscape level decision support tool intended to help firefighters consider the magnitude and spatial distribution of snag hazard in their incident response strategy planning. Valid uses include identifying areas of higher snag hazard locations on landscape that may require extra mitigation for safe operation or could be avoided to reduce risk to responders. The snag hazard map is not meant to identify individual dead trees or for tactical planning. A rating of low snag hazard does not mean that no overhead hazards are present and should not be interpreted as judgement that an area is safe to occupy. Conditions should always be verified in the field. High levels of awareness for overhead hazards are always recommended regardless of the snag hazard rating.</span></p></div></div>",U.S. Forest Service,USFSEnterpriseContent,mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov,2023-05-31,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/cb4800493f7e4fb28722bcde05eee71c/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139,dcat:Distribution,public

Next Generation Fire Severity Mapping (Image Service),"The geospatial products described and distributed here depict the probability of high-severity fire, if a fire were to occur, for several ecoregions in the contiguous western US. The ecological effects of wildland fire � also termed the fire severity � are often highly heterogeneous in space and time. This heterogeneity is a result of spatial variability in factors such as fuel, topography, and climate (e.g. mean annual temperature). However, temporally variable factors such as daily weather and climatic extremes (e.g. an unusually warm year) also may play a key role. Scientists from the US Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station and the University of Montana conducted a study in which observed data were used to produce statistical models describing the probability of high severity fire as a function of fuel, topography, climate, and fire weather. Observed data from over 2000 fires (from 2002-2015) were used to build individual models for each of 19 ecoregions in the contiguous US (see Parks et al. 2018, Figure 1). High severity fire was measured using a fire severity metric termed the relativized burn ratio, which uses pre- and post-fire Landsat imagery to measure fire-induced ecological change. Fuel included pre-fire metrics of live fuel amount such as NDVI. Topography included factors such as slope and potential solar radiation. Climate summarized 30-year averages of factors such as mean summer temperature that spatially vary across the study area. Lastly, fire weather incorporated temporally variable factors such as daily and annual temperature. In turn, these statistical models were used to generate 'wall-to-wall' maps depicting the probability of high severity fire, if a fire were to occur, for 13 of the 19 ecoregions. Maps were not produced for ecoregions in which model quality was deemed inadequate. All maps use fuel data representing the year 2016 and therefore provide a fairly up-to-date assessment of the potential for high severity fire. For those ecoregions in which the relative influence of fire weather was fairly strong (n=6), two additional maps were produced, one depicting the probability of high severity fire under moderate weather and the other under extreme weather. An important consideration is that only pixels defined as forest were used to build the models; consequently maps exclude pixels considered non-forest.",U.S. Forest Service,USFSEnterpriseContent,mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov,2022-08-25,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/870b0a1777d5455faab124e7db96824b/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139,dcat:Distribution,public

NorWeST Stream Temperatures 2080s (Feature Layer),"This layer represents modeled stream temperatures derived from the 
NorWeST point feature class (NorWest_TemperaturePoints). NorWeST summer 
stream temperature scenarios were developed for all rivers and streams 
in the western U.S. from the &gt; 20,000 stream sites in the NorWeST 
database where mean August stream temperatures were recorded. The 
resulting dataset includes stream lines (NorWeST_PredictedStreams) and 
associated mid-points NorWest_TemperaturePoints) representing 1 
kilometer intervals along the stream network. Stream lines were derived 
from the 1:100,000 scale NHDPlus dataset (USEPA and USGS 2010; McKay et 
al. 2012). Shapefile extents correspond to NorWeST processing units, 
which generally relate to 6 digit (3rd code) hydrologic unit codes 
(HUCs) or in some instances closely correspond to state borders. The 
line and point shapefiles contain identical modeled stream temperature 
results. The two feature classes are meant to complement one another for
 use in different applications. In addition, spatial and temporal

NorWeST stream temperature data summaries for the western U.S.,"NorWeST is an interagency stream temperature database and model for the western United States containing data from over 20,000 unique stream locations. Temperature observations were solicited from state, federal, tribal, private, and municipal resource organizations and processed using a custom cleaning script developed by Gwynne Chandler. Summaries of daily, weekly, and monthly means, minima, and maxima are provided for observation years. The data summaries and location information are available in user-friendly file formats that include: 1) a map (PDF) depicting the locations of in-stream thermographs (temperature sensors) for each processing unit, 2) a GIS shapefile (SHP) containing the location of these sensors for each processing unit, and 3) a tabular file (XLSX) containing observed temperature database summaries for data generally ranging from 1993 to 2015, dependent on the processing unit. Each point shapefile extent corresponds to NorWeST processing units, which generally relate to 6 digit (3rd code) hydrologic unit codes (HUCs).

Northern New Mexico post-fire refugia data,"This publication contains spatial data, tabular data and scripts used to analyze the spatial patterns of refugia and associated plant communities following each of several fires in northern New Mexico. Four of the geotiff files were derived during the project (*Kernel.tif) using dNBR (delta Normalized Burn Ratio) or dNDVI (delta Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). The kernel raster data represent density of unburned/low severity grid cells in approximately 10-hectare neighborhoods following the Cerro Grande, Dome, La Mesa, and Las Conchas fire events in 2000, 1996, 1977, and 2011, respectively. The data were produced using a kernel smooth process, with output values range from 0 to 1, representing a gradient in neighborhood density of refugia. In addition, geotiff files of the dNBR for Las Conchas (this version is not available at mtbs.gov, but was provided for the study by S. Howard, USGS-EROS), the dNDVI for La Mesa and the La Mesa footprint (both developed for the Fire atlas for the Gila and Aldo Leopold Wilderness Areas project; https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2015-0023) are also included. Finally, the archive contains a digital elevation model (developed by USGS-EROS), cropped to the study area; the DEM was used to derive terrain metrics describing topographic heterogeneity at local and catchment scales. The text files contain R scripts and associated tabular data that can be used to repeat the analysis presented in the publication by performing the following functions: 1) generate the kernel rasters (kernel geotiffs described, above); 2) generate terrain metrics from DEM (geotiff included), 3) sample the kernel rasters, terrain metric outputs and 1 kilometer resolution bioclimatic data (downloaded from https://adaptwest.databasin.org/pages/adaptwest-climatena); 4) develop environmental models from the raster sample data (text file included); and 5) conduct a multivariate analysis of species and communities using species data recorded in the field (text file included).",U.S. Forest Service,USFSEnterpriseContent,mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov,2022-08-25,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/cbb7b77da1b747c19be505725425d4be/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139,dcat:Distribution,public
Northern Plains High Resolution Land Cover (Image Service),"<div>Data are intended for use in rural areas and therefore do not include land cover in cities and towns.

Probabilistic Wildfire Risk (Map Service),"National burn probability (BP) and conditional fire intensity level (FIL) data were generated for the conterminous United States (US) using a geospatial Fire Simulation (FSim) system developed by the US Forest Service Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory to estimate probabilistic components of wildfire risk (Finney et al. [2011]). The FSim system includes modules for weather generation, wildfire occurrence, fire growth, and fire suppression. FSim is designed to simulate the occurrence and growth of wildfires under tens of thousands of hypothetical contemporary fire seasons in order to estimate the probability of a given area (i.e., pixel) burning under current landscape conditions and fire management practices. The data presented here represent modeled BP and FIL for the conterminous US at a 270-meter grid spatial resolution. The six FILs correspond to flame-length classes as follows: FIL1 = &lt; 2 feet (ft); FIL2 = 2 &lt; 4 ft.; FIL3 = 4 &lt; 6 ft.; FIL4 = 6 &lt; 8 ft.; FIL5 = 8 &lt; 12 ft.; FIL6 = 12+ ft. Because they indicate conditional probabilities (i.e., representing the likelihood of burning at a certain intensity level, given that a fire occurs), the FIL*_20160830 data must be used in conjunction with the BP_20160830 data for risk assessment.",U.S. Forest Service,USFSEnterpriseContent,mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov,2022-08-25,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/203afc0fea1a411fa2147ba9c5ef6119/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139,dcat:Distribution,public

Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire (RAVG) Composite Burn Index (Map Service),"The USDA Forest Service Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire (RAVG) program produces geospatial data and maps of post-fire vegetation condition using standardized change detection methods based on Landsat or similar multispectral satellite imagery. RAVG data products characterize vegetation condition within a fire perimeter, and include estimates of percent change in basal area (BA), percent change in canopy cover (CC), and a standardized composite burn index (CBI). Standard thematic products include 7-class percent change in basal area (BA-7), 5-class percent change in canopy cover (CC-5), and 4-class CBI (CBI-4). Contingent upon the availability of suitable imagery, RAVG products are prepared for all wildland fires reported within the conterminous United States (CONUS) that include at least 1000 acres of forested National Forest System (NFS) land (500 acres for Regions 8 and 9 as of 2016). Data for individual fires are typically made available within 45 days after fire containment ('initial assessments'). Late-season fires, however, may be deferred until the following spring or summer ('extended assessments'). National mosaics of each thematic product are prepared annually. Mosaics of extended assessments, if any, are provided separately from initial assessment mosaics.

Simulated data for Secondary organic aerosol formation in biomass-burning plumes: Theoretical analysis from lab studies and ambient plumes,"The volatile nature of biomass burning organics may complicate the evolution of organics in laboratory smog-chamber experiments and in ambient plumes. We simulate the evolution of organic mass (including gas and particles) in the chamber experiments using the TwO-Moment Aerosol Sectional (TOMAS) microphysics model combined with a secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production matrix. We estimate the effect of vapor wall loss by turning off the vapor wall loss, and also added Gaussian dispersion to our aerosol-microphysical model to SOA formation under different ambient-plume conditions. A detailed description of model setup and results can be found in Bian et al. 2017. The data publication here contains simulation datasets generated using the TOMAS microphysics model combined with a secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production matrix. Datasets are organized according to the figures in Bian et al. 2017 and include 1) chemistry-only simulation data; 2) data generated using the TOMAS model combined with particle and vapor wall-loss algorithms and a SOA production matrix with varying parameters; and 3) simulation data generated using the TOMAS model assuming the plume volume follows the Gaussian dispersion.

Spatial dataset of probabilistic wildfire risk components for the conterminous United States,"National burn probability (BP) and conditional fire intensity level (FIL) data were generated for the conterminous United States (US) using a geospatial Fire Simulation (FSim) system developed by the US Forest Service Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory to estimate probabilistic components of wildfire risk (Finney et al. [2011]). The FSim system includes modules for weather generation, wildfire occurrence, fire growth, and fire suppression. FSim is designed to simulate the occurrence and growth of wildfires under tens of thousands of hypothetical contemporary fire seasons in order to estimate the probability of a given area (i.e., pixel) burning under current landscape conditions and fire management practices. The data presented here represent modeled BP and FIL for the conterminous US at a 270-meter grid spatial resolution. The six FILs correspond to flame-length classes as follows: FIL1 = &lt; 2 feet (ft); FIL2 = 2 &lt; 4 ft.; FIL3 = 4 &lt; 6 ft.; FIL4 = 6 &lt; 8 ft.; FIL5 = 8 &lt; 12 ft.; FIL6 = 12+ ft. Because they indicate conditional probabilities (i.e., representing the likelihood of burning at a certain intensity level, given that a fire occurs), the FIL*_20160830 data must be used in conjunction with the BP_20160830 data for risk assessment.",U.S. Forest Service,USFSEnterpriseContent,mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov,2022-08-25,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/dc4aae9f93064f9496f8731ace6b4583/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139,dcat:Distribution,public

Species occurrence data from the Range-Wide Bull Trout eDNA Project,"These data include 2015 - 2018 eDNA field sample points indicating lab results for presence or absence of bull trout. Sample sites are spaced at a 1 kilometer interval throughout the historical range of bull trout. eDNA stream samples are collected and species presence/absence is determined by analyses at the National Genomics Center. Results are recorded in the feature attribute table of the eDNA sample site shapefile. One point feature in the shapefile was generated for each 1 kilometer sample point in the bull trout eDNA feature class. Where multiple samples were collected at a single eDNA sample site, replicate point features will occur at a single location in the shapefile. The bull trout is an ESA-listed species with a historical range that encompasses many waters across the Northwest. Though once abundant, bull trout have declined in many locations and are at risk from a changing climate, nonnative species, and habitat degradation. Informed conservation planning relies on sound and precise information about the distribution of bull trout in thousands of streams, but gathering this information is a daunting and expensive task. To overcome this problem, we coupled 1) predictions from the range-wide, spatially precise Climate Shield model on the location of natal habitats of bull trout with 2) a sampling template for every 8-digit hydrologic unit in the historical range of bull trout, based on the probability of detecting bull trout presence using environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling (McKelvey et al. 2016). The template consists of a master set of geospatially referenced sampling locations at 1-kilometer intervals within each cold-water habitat. We also identified sampling locations at this same interval based on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's (USFWS) designation of critical spawning and rearing habitat. Based on field tests of eDNA detection probabilities conducted by the National Genomics Center for Wildlife and Fish Conservation, this sampling approach will reliably determine the presence of populations of bull trout, as well as provide insights on non-spawning habitats used by adult and subadult fish. The completed bull trout eDNA survey results are available through an interactive ArcGIS Online Map. The map provides the ability to zoom in and look at an area of interest, as well as to create queries or select an area to download points as a shapefile.",U.S. Forest Service,USFSEnterpriseContent,mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov,2022-08-25,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/0717728fd9974dae85b6c9c37c586402/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139,dcat:Distribution,public

America's private forests provide a vast array of public goods and services, including abundant, clean surface water. Forest loss and development can affect water quality and quantity when forests are removed and impervious surfaces, such as paved roads, spread across the landscape. We rank watersheds across the conterminous United States according to the contributions of private forest land to surface drinking water and by threats to surface water from increased housing density. Private forest land contributions to drinking water are greatest in the East but are also important in Western watersheds. Development pressures on these contributions are concentrated in the Eastern United States but are also found in the North-Central region, parts of the West and Southwest, and the Pacific Northwest; nationwide, more than 55 million acres of rural private forest land are projected to experience a substantial increase in housing density from 2000 to 2030. Planners, communities, and private landowners can use a range of strategies to maintain freshwater ecosystems, including designing housing and roads to minimize impacts on water quality, managing home sites to protect water resources, and using payment schemes and management partnerships to invest in forest stewardship on public and private lands.This data is based on the digital hydrologic unit boundary layer to the Subwatershed (12-digit) 6th level for the continental United States. To focus this analysis on watersheds with private forests, only watersheds with at least 10% forested land and more than 50 acres of private forest were analyzed. All other watersheds were labeled ?Insufficient private forest for this analysis'and coded -99999 in the data table.

Terrestrial Condition Assessment (TCA) Wildfire Hazard Potential Fire Regime Groups 1 and 2 (Map Service),"The 2018 Wildland Hazard Potential (WHP) represents areas of uncharacteristic fuel buildup. The WFP is a raster geospatial product produced by the USFS Fire Modeling Institute in the Fire, Fuel, and Smoke Program. Higher values have a higher probability of high-intensity fire, with torching, crowning, and other forms of extreme fire behavior. Data used represent areas classified as  high  or  very high  hazard. The LANDFIRE Fire Regime Groups (FRG) raster dataset (US_140FRG_10252017) was used to identify moderate fire regimes (Regimes I and II). Fire regime groups represent expected historical fire regimes based on interactions between vegetation dynamics, fire spread, fire effects, and spatial context.

Timber Appraisal Zones (Feature Layer),"This dataset is a spatial display of US Forest Service stumpage market appraisal zones. A zone may encompass a Region, a National Forest, a group of Ranger Districts, or combinations thereof. Each unique market appraisal zone defines a localized stumpage market. In each market area, stumpage values reflect the market value of standing trees (on the stump) prior to felling, removal, and utilization in a value-added manufacturing activity. The zone boundary is typically determined by factors including, but not limited to, manufacturing facilities, hauling distances, species yield compositions, timber quality, market area competition, and logging methods. <a href='https://apps.fs.usda.gov/arcx/rest/services/EDW/EDW_TimberAppraisalZones_01/MapServer/1/metadata' style='font-size:12pt;' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>Timber Appraisal Zone Metadata</a>",U.S. Forest Service,USFSEnterpriseContent,mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov,2023-07-12,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/4de75a62c14a42778583a9495d2d16c0/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139,dcat:Distribution,public

"Tree and shrub measurements in Stanislaus National Forest and Yosemite National Park, collected in 1911 and 20052013","This data publication contains tabular data with repeat measurements of tree and shrub data for a set of transects located in Stanislaus National Forest (STF) and Yosemite National Park (YOSE) in California. These transects represent part of a systematic timber inventory collected across a large mixed-conifer dominated landscape by the U.S. Forest Service in 1911. Trees were tallied by species, diameter and height within 40 x 400 meter (m) strips that spanned the center of quarter-quarter sections (QQs) delineated by the Public Land Survey System. Shrub cover was determined using an ocular estimate. Repeat data were collected in either 2005, 2007 or 2013 in three to four 0.1 hectare circular plots (radius 17.8 m) per transect, centered at random, non-overlapping distances along the historical transect centerline. This data publication therefore contains measurements such as the percentage cover of shrubs for multiple species, basal area of dead and live conifer trees, and density of live conifer trees with various diameters at breast height for both STF and YOSE in 1911 and the remeasurement year of 2005, 2007, or 2013.",U.S. Forest Service,USFSEnterpriseContent,mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov,2022-08-25,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/67bea889ca8d4a92a78d5e46519b1775/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139,dcat:Distribution,public

TreeMap 2016 is being used in both the private and public sectors for projects including fuel treatment planning, snag hazard mapping, and estimation of terrestrial carbon resources. We used a random forests machine-learning algorithm to impute the forest plot data to a set of target rasters provided by Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools (LANDFIRE: https://landfire.gov). Predictor variables consisted of percent forest cover, height, and vegetation type, as well as topography (slope, elevation, and aspect), location (latitude and longitude), biophysical variables (photosynthetically active radiation, precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, relative humidity, and vapour pressure deficit), and disturbance history (time since disturbance and disturbance type) for the landscape circa 2016. The main output of this project (the GeoTIFF included in this data publication) is a raster map of imputed plot identifiers at 30X30 m spatial resolution for the conterminous U.S. for landscape conditions circa 2016. In the attribute table of this raster, we also present a set of attributes drawn from the FIA databases, including forest type and live basal area. The raster map of plot identifiers can be linked to the FIA databases available through the FIA DataMart (https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2001-FIADB).

Application of the dataset to research questions other than those for which it has been validated should be investigated by the researcher before proceeding.

Other attributes have not been validated as of this writing on 2/25/2022. Accuracy may vary regionally. This dataset is for the landscape circa 2016 and does not capture disturbances such as fire and land management after that date. Based on a set of FIA validation plots, these data have moderate to high accuracy at point locations for forest cover, height, vegetation group, and recent disturbance by fire and insects and disease (Riley et al. 2021). Summary statistics at Baileys section and subsection levels indicate high accuracy in most sections and subsections when compared to FIA statistics for live basal area, number of live trees greater than or equal to 1 diameter, live cubic-foot volume, and live-tree biomass. Estimates of number of dead trees greater than or equal to 5 diameter and dead tree above-ground biomass have lower correlations with FIA estimates, which are driven largely by the fact that TreeMap does not include areas where live tree cover is less than 10% while FIA does, meaning that severely disturbed areas are not included in mapping. In general, the TreeMap data are appropriately used for planning and policy-level analyses and decisions. Local map accuracy is suitable for many local-scale decisions regarding questions around forest cover, height, vegetation group, and recent disturbances. For other attributes provided here, formal validation has not been completed, and assessment at local scales is advised and must be driven by project-specific needs.

Summary statistics at Baileys section and subsection levels indicate high accuracy in most sections and subsections when compared to FIA statistics for live basal area, number of live trees greater than or equal to 1 diameter, live cubic-foot volume, and live-tree biomass. Estimates of number of dead trees greater than or equal to 5 diameter and dead tree above-ground biomass have lower correlations with FIA estimates, which are driven largely by the fact that TreeMap does not include areas where live tree cover is less than 10% while FIA does, meaning that severely disturbed areas are not included in mapping. In general, the TreeMap data are appropriately used for planning and policy-level analyses and decisions. Local map accuracy is suitable for many local-scale decisions regarding questions around forest cover, height, vegetation group, and recent disturbances. For other attributes provided here, formal validation has not been completed, and assessment at local scales is advised and must be driven by project-specific needs.

TreeMap 2016 is being used in both the private and public sectors for projects including fuel treatment planning, snag hazard mapping, and estimation of terrestrial carbon resources. We used a random forests machine-learning algorithm to impute the forest plot data to a set of target rasters provided by Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools (LANDFIRE: https://landfire.gov). Predictor variables consisted of percent forest cover, height, and vegetation type, as well as topography (slope, elevation, and aspect), location (latitude and longitude), biophysical variables (photosynthetically active radiation, precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, relative humidity, and vapour pressure deficit), and disturbance history (time since disturbance and disturbance type) for the landscape circa 2016. The main output of this project (the GeoTIFF included in this data publication) is a raster map of imputed plot identifiers at 30X30 m spatial resolution for the conterminous U.S. for landscape conditions circa 2016. In the attribute table of this raster, we also present a set of attributes drawn from the FIA databases, including forest type and live basal area. The raster map of plot identifiers can be linked to the FIA databases available through the FIA DataMart (https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2001-FIADB). The dataset has been validated for applications including percent live tree cover, height of the dominant trees, forest type, species of trees with most basal area, aboveground biomass, fuel treatment planning, and snag hazard. Application of the dataset to research questions other than those for which it has been validated should be investigated by the researcher before proceeding.

TreeMap 2016 is being used in both the private and public sectors for projects including fuel treatment planning, snag hazard mapping, and estimation of terrestrial carbon resources. We used a random forests machine-learning algorithm to impute the forest plot data to a set of target rasters provided by Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools (LANDFIRE: https://landfire.gov). Predictor variables consisted of percent forest cover, height, and vegetation type, as well as topography (slope, elevation, and aspect), location (latitude and longitude), biophysical variables (photosynthetically active radiation, precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, relative humidity, and vapour pressure deficit), and disturbance history (time since disturbance and disturbance type) for the landscape circa 2016. The main output of this project (the GeoTIFF included in this data publication) is a raster map of imputed plot identifiers at 30X30 m spatial resolution for the conterminous U.S. for landscape conditions circa 2016. In the attribute table of this raster, we also present a set of attributes drawn from the FIA databases, including forest type and live basal area. The raster map of plot identifiers can be linked to the FIA databases available through the FIA DataMart (https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2001-FIADB). The dataset has been validated for applications including percent live tree cover, height of the dominant trees, forest type, species of trees with most basal area, aboveground biomass, fuel treatment planning, and snag hazard. Application of the dataset to research questions other than those for which it has been validated should be investigated by the researcher before proceeding. The dataset may be suitable for other applications and for use across various scales (stand, landscape, and region), however, the researcher should test the dataset's applicability to a particular research question before proceeding. <br /></div><div><br /></div><div>This raster dataset represents model output generated by a random forests method that assigns Forest Inventory Analysis plot identifiers to a 30x30m grid (Riley et al. 2016 and Riley et al. 2021). Some attributes provided have been validated as detailed below, and we have high confidence they would be suitable for stand, county, and national scale analyses. Other attributes have not been validated as of this writing on 2/25/2022. Accuracy may vary regionally. This dataset is for the landscape circa 2016 and does not capture disturbances such as fire and land management after that date. Based on a set of FIA validation plots, these data have moderate to high accuracy at point locations for forest cover, height, vegetation group, and recent disturbance by fire and insects and disease (Riley et al. 2021). Summary statistics at Baileys section and subsection levels indicate high accuracy in most sections and subsections when compared to FIA statistics for live basal area, number of live trees greater than or equal to 1 diameter, live cubic-foot volume, and live-tree biomass. Estimates of number of dead trees greater than or equal to 5 diameter and dead tree above-ground biomass have lower correlations with FIA estimates, which are driven largely by the fact that TreeMap does not include areas where live tree cover is less than 10% while FIA does, meaning that severely disturbed areas are not included in mapping. In general, the TreeMap data are appropriately used for planning and policy-level analyses and decisions. Local map accuracy is suitable for many local-scale decisions regarding questions around forest cover, height, vegetation group, and recent disturbances. For other attributes provided here, formal validation has not been completed, and assessment at local scales is advised and must be driven by project-specific needs.

TreeMap 2016 is being used in both the private and public sectors for projects including fuel treatment planning, snag hazard mapping, and estimation of terrestrial carbon resources. We used a random forests machine-learning algorithm to impute the forest plot data to a set of target rasters provided by Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools (LANDFIRE: https://landfire.gov). Predictor variables consisted of percent forest cover, height, and vegetation type, as well as topography (slope, elevation, and aspect), location (latitude and longitude), biophysical variables (photosynthetically active radiation, precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, relative humidity, and vapour pressure deficit), and disturbance history (time since disturbance and disturbance type) for the landscape circa 2016. The main output of this project (the GeoTIFF included in this data publication) is a raster map of imputed plot identifiers at 30X30 m spatial resolution for the conterminous U.S. for landscape conditions circa 2016. In the attribute table of this raster, we also present a set of attributes drawn from the FIA databases, including forest type and live basal area. The raster map of plot identifiers can be linked to the FIA databases available through the FIA DataMart (https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2001-FIADB). The dataset has been validated for applications including percent live tree cover, height of the dominant trees, forest type, species of trees with most basal area, aboveground biomass, fuel treatment planning, and snag hazard. Application of the dataset to research questions other than those for which it has been validated should be investigated by the researcher before proceeding. The dataset may be suitable for other applications and for use across various scales (stand, landscape, and region), however, the researcher should test the dataset's applicability to a particular research question before proceeding. <br /></div><div><br /></div><div>This raster dataset represents model output generated by a random forests method that assigns Forest Inventory Analysis plot identifiers to a 30x30m grid (Riley et al. 2016 and Riley et al. 2021). Some attributes provided have been validated as detailed below, and we have high confidence they would be suitable for stand, county, and national scale analyses. Other attributes have not been validated as of this writing on 2/25/2022. Accuracy may vary regionally. This dataset is for the landscape circa 2016 and does not capture disturbances such as fire and land management after that date. Based on a set of FIA validation plots, these data have moderate to high accuracy at point locations for forest cover, height, vegetation group, and recent disturbance by fire and insects and disease (Riley et al. 2021). Summary statistics at Baileys section and subsection levels indicate high accuracy in most sections and subsections when compared to FIA statistics for live basal area, number of live trees greater than or equal to 1 diameter, live cubic-foot volume, and live-tree biomass. Estimates of number of dead trees greater than or equal to 5 diameter and dead tree above-ground biomass have lower correlations with FIA estimates, which are driven largely by the fact that TreeMap does not include areas where live tree cover is less than 10% while FIA does, meaning that severely disturbed areas are not included in mapping. In general, the TreeMap data are appropriately used for planning and policy-level analyses and decisions. Local map accuracy is suitable for many local-scale decisions regarding questions around forest cover, height, vegetation group, and recent disturbances. For other attributes provided here, formal validation has not been completed, and assessment at local scales is advised and must be driven by project-specific needs.

Predictor variables consisted of percent forest cover, height, and vegetation type, as well as topography (slope, elevation, and aspect), location (latitude and longitude), biophysical variables (photosynthetically active radiation, precipitation, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, relative humidity, and vapour pressure deficit), and disturbance history (time since disturbance and disturbance type) for the landscape circa 2016. The main output of this project (the GeoTIFF included in this data publication) is a raster map of imputed plot identifiers at 30X30 m spatial resolution for the conterminous U.S. for landscape conditions circa 2016. In the attribute table of this raster, we also present a set of attributes drawn from the FIA databases, including forest type and live basal area. The raster map of plot identifiers can be linked to the FIA databases available through the FIA DataMart (https://doi.org/10.2737/RDS-2001-FIADB). The dataset has been validated for applications including percent live tree cover, height of the dominant trees, forest type, species of trees with most basal area, aboveground biomass, fuel treatment planning, and snag hazard. Application of the dataset to research questions other than those for which it has been validated should be investigated by the researcher before proceeding. The dataset may be suitable for other applications and for use across various scales (stand, landscape, and region), however, the researcher should test the dataset's applicability to a particular research question before proceeding. <br /></div><div><br /></div><div>This raster dataset represents model output generated by a random forests method that assigns Forest Inventory Analysis plot identifiers to a 30x30m grid (Riley et al. 2016 and Riley et al. 2021).

Estimates of number of dead trees greater than or equal to 5 diameter and dead tree above-ground biomass have lower correlations with FIA estimates, which are driven largely by the fact that TreeMap does not include areas where live tree cover is less than 10% while FIA does, meaning that severely disturbed areas are not included in mapping. In general, the TreeMap data are appropriately used for planning and policy-level analyses and decisions. Local map accuracy is suitable for many local-scale decisions regarding questions around forest cover, height, vegetation group, and recent disturbances.

Tribal Lands Ceded to the United States (Feature Layer),"<span style='color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:14.4px; background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);'>Sixty-seven maps from Indian Land Cessions in the United States, compiled by Charles C. Royce and published as the second part of the two-part Eighteenth Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, 1896-1897 have been scanned, georeferenced in JPEG2000 format, and digitized to create this feature class of cession maps. The mapped cessions and reservations included in the 67 maps correspond to entries in the Schedule of Indian Land Cessions, indicating the number and location of each cession by or reservation for the Indian tribes from the organization of the Federal Government to and including 1894, together with descriptions of the tracts so ceded or reserved, the date of the treaty, law or executive order governing the same, the name of the tribe or tribes affected thereby, and historical data and references bearing thereon, as set forth in the subtitle of the Schedule. Go to this URL for full metadata: https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.TRIBALCEDEDLANDS.xml Each Royce map was georeferenced against one or more of the following USGS 1:2,000,000 National Atlas Feature Classes contained in \NatlAtlas_USGS.gdb: cities_2mm, hydro_ln_2mm, hydro_pl_2mm, plss_2mm, states_2mm. Cessions were digitized as a file geodatabase (GDB) polygon feature class, projected as NAD83 USA_Contiguous_Lambert_Conformal_Conic, which is the same projection used to georeference the maps. The feature class was later reprojected to WGS 1984 Web Mercator (auxiliary sphere) to optimize it for the Tribal Connections Map Viewer. Polygon boundaries were digitized as to not deviate from the drawn polygon edge to the extent that space could be seen between the digitized polygon and the mapped polygon at a viewable scale. Topology was maintained between coincident edges of adjacent polygons. The cession map number assigned by Royce was entered into the feature class as a field attribute. The Map Cession ID serves as the link referencing relationship classes and joining additional attribute information to 752 polygon features, to include the following: 1. Data transcribed from Royce's Schedule of Indian Land Cessions: a. Date(s), in the case of treaties, the date the treaty was signed, not the date of the proclamation; b. Tribe(s), the tribal name(s) used in the treaty and/or the Schedule; and c. Map Name(s), the name of the map(s) on which a cession number appears; 2. URLs for the corresponding entry in the Schedule of Indian Land Cessions (Internet Archive) for each unique combination of a Date and reference to a Map Cession ID (historical references in the Schedule are included); 3. URLs for the corresponding treaty text, including the treaties catalogued by Charles J. Kappler in Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties (HathiTrust Digital Library), executive order or other federal statute (Library of Congress and University of Georgia) identified in each entry with a reference to a Map Cession ID or IDs; 4. URLs for the image of the Royce map(s) (Library of Congress) on which a given cession number appears; 5. The name(s) of the Indian tribe or tribes related to each mapped cession, including the name as it appeared in the Schedule or the corresponding primary text, as well as the name of the present-day Indian tribe or tribes; and 6. The present-day states and counties included wholly or partially within a Map Cession boundary. During the 2017-2018 revision of the attribute data, it was noted that 7 of the Cession Map IDs are missing spatial representation in the Feature Class. The missing data is associated with the following Cession Map IDs: 47 (Illinois 1), 65 (Tennessee and Bordering States), 128 (Georgia), 129 (Georgia), 130 (Georgia), 543 (Indian Territory 3), and 690 (Iowa 2), which will be updated in the future. This dataset revises and expands the dataset published in 2015 by the U.S. Forest Service and made available through the Tribal Connections viewer, the Forest Service Geodata Clearinghouse, and Data.gov. The 2018 dataset is a result of collaboration between the Department of Agriculture, U.S. Forest Service, Office of Tribal Relations (OTR); the Department of the Interior, National Park Service, National NAGPRA Program; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of International and Tribal Affairs, American Indian Environmental Office; and Dr. Claudio Saunt of the University of Georgia. The Forest Service and Dr. Saunt independently digitized and georeferenced the Royce cession maps and developed online map viewers to display Native American land cessions and reservations. Dr. Saunt subsequently undertook additional research to link Schedule entries, treaty texts, federal statutes and executive orders to cession and reservation polygons, which he agreed to share with the U.S. Forest Service. OTR revised the data, linking the Schedule entries, treaty texts, federal statues and executive orders to all 1,172 entries in the attribute table. The 2018 dataset has incorporated data made available by the National NAGPRA Program, specifically the Indian tribe or tribes related to each mapped cession, including the name as it appeared in the Schedule or the corresponding primary text and the name of the present-day Indian tribe or tribes, as well as the present-day states and counties included wholly or partially within a Map Cession boundary. This data replaces in its entirety the National NAGPRA data included in the dataset published in 2015. The 2015 dataset incorporated data presented in state tables compiled from the Schedule of Indian Land Cessions by the National NAGPRA Program. In recent years the National NAGPRA Program has been working to ensure the accuracy of this data, including the reevaluation of the present-day Indian tribes and the provision of references for their determinations. Changes made by the OTR have not been reviewed or approved by the National NAGPRA Program. The Forest Service will continue to collaborate with other federal agencies and work to improve the accuracy of the data included in this dataset. Errors identified since the dataset was published in 2015 have been corrected, and we request that you notify us of any additional errors we may have missed or that have been introduced. Please contact Rebecca Hill, Policy Analyst, U.S. Forest Service, Office of Tribal Relations, at rebeccahill@fs.usda.gov with any questions or concerns with regard to the data included in this dataset.</span>",U.S. Forest Service,USFSEnterpriseContent,mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov,2023-10-23,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/e4e788be8cfc4d1f8ff280a81ffaa69c/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139,dcat:Distribution,public
"US Forest Atlas FIA Modeled Abundance, Forest-type Groups, Harvest and Carbon (Rest Services Directory)","<b>FIA Modeled Abundance:�</b><div>This dataset portrays the live tree mean basal area (square feet per acre) of the species across the contiguous United States. The underlying data publication contains raster maps of live tree basal area for each tree species along with corresponding assessment data. An efficient approach for mapping multiple individual tree species over large spatial domains was used to develop these raster datasets. The method integrates vegetation phenology derived from MODIS imagery and raster data describing relevant environmental parameters with extensive field plot data of tree species basal area to create maps of tree species abundance and distribution at a 250-meter (m) pixel size for the contiguous United States. The approach uses the modeling techniques of k-nearest neighbors and canonical correspondence analysis, where model predictions are calculated using a weighting of nearest neighbors based on proximity in a feature space derived from the model. The approach also utilizes a stratification derived from the 2001 National Land-Cover Database tree canopy cover layer.�</div><div><br /></div><div>This data depicts current species abundance and distribution across the contiguous United States, modeled by using FIA field plot data.

USFS Analytical 2011 Tree Canopy Cover Puerto Rico Virgin Islands (Image Service),"The USDA Forest Service (USFS) builds multiple versions of percent tree canopy cover data, in order to serve needs of multiple user communities. These datasets encompass CONUS, Coastal Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. There are three versions of data within the 2016 TCC Product Suite, which include: 
The initial model outputs referred to as the Analytical data; 
A masked version of the initial output referred to as Cartographic data; 
And a modified version built for the National Land Cover Database and referred to as NLCD data, which includes a canopy cover change dataset derived from subtraction of datasets for the nominal years of 2011 and 2016. 
The Analytical data are the initial model outputs generated in the production workflow. These data are best suited for users who will carry out their own detailed statistical and uncertainty analyses on the dataset and place lower priority on the visual appearance of the dataset for cartographic purposes. Datasets for the nominal years of 2011 and 2016 are available. 

The Cartographic products mask the initial model outputs to improve the visual appearance of the datasets. These data are best suited for users who prioritize visual appearance of the data for cartographic and illustrative purposes. Datasets for the nominal years of 2011 and 2016 are available. 

The NLCD data are the result of further processing of the masked data. The goal was to generate three coordinated components. The components are (1) a dataset for the nominal year of 2011, (2) a dataset for the nominal year of 2016, and (3) a dataset that captures the change in canopy cover between the two nominal years of 2011 and 2016.

USFS Analytical 2016 Tree Canopy Cover Standard Error CONUS (Image Service),"The USDA Forest Service (USFS) builds multiple versions of percent tree canopy cover data, in order to serve needs of multiple user communities. These datasets encompass CONUS, Coastal Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. There are three versions of data within the 2016 TCC Product Suite, which include:The initial model outputs referred to as the Analytical data;A masked version of the initial output referred to as Cartographic data;And a modified version built for the National Land Cover Database and referred to as NLCD data, which includes a canopy cover change dataset derived from subtraction of datasets for the nominal years of 2011 and 2016.The Analytical data are the initial model outputs generated in the production workflow. These data are best suited for users who will carry out their own detailed statistical and uncertainty analyses on the dataset and place lower priority on the visual appearance of the dataset for cartographic purposes. Datasets for the nominal years of 2011 and 2016 are available. The Cartographic products mask the initial model outputs to improve the visual appearance of the datasets. These data are best suited for users who prioritize visual appearance of the data for cartographic and illustrative purposes. Datasets for the nominal years of 2011 and 2016 are available. The NLCD data are the result of further processing of the masked data. The goal was to generate three coordinated components. The components are (1) a dataset for the nominal year of 2011, (2) a dataset for the nominal year of 2016, and (3) a dataset that captures the change in canopy cover between the two nominal years of 2011 and 2016. For the NLCD data, the three components meet the criterion of �2011 TCC + change in TCC = 2016 TCC�. These NLCD data are best suited for users who require a coordinated three-component data stack where each pixel�s values meet the criterion of �2011 TCC + change in TCC = 2016 TCC�.

USFS Cartographic 2016 Tree Canopy Cover Puerto Rico Virgin Islands (Map Service),"The USDA Forest Service (USFS) builds multiple versions of percent tree canopy cover data, in order to serve needs of multiple user communities. These datasets encompass CONUS, Coastal Alaska, Hawaii, U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. There are three versions of data within the 2016 TCC Product Suite, which include: The initial model outputs referred to as the Analytical data; A masked version of the initial output referred to as Cartographic data; And a modified version built for the National Land Cover Database and referred to as NLCD data, which includes a canopy cover change dataset derived from subtraction of datasets for the nominal years of 2011 and 2016. The Analytical data are the initial model outputs generated in the production workflow.

United States annual state-level population estimates from colonization to 1999,The U.S. landscape has undergone substantial changes since Europeans first arrived. Many land use changes are attributable to human activity. Historical data concerning these changes are frequently limited and often difficult to develop. Modeling historical land use changes may be necessary. We develop annual population series from first European settlement to 1999 for all 50 states and Washington D.C. for use in modeling land use trends. Extensive research went into developing the historical data. Linear interpolation was used to complete the series after critically evaluating the appropriateness of linear interpolation versus exponential interpolation.,U.S. Forest Service,USFSEnterpriseContent,mailto:SM.FS.data@usda.gov,2022-08-25,https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/61f658e7b066442b9beb3db5cc5f3bd5/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=iso19139,dcat:Distribution,public

Wildfire Risk to Communities Burn Probability (Image Service),"This dataset is the Burn Probability (BP) for the United States. It is part of the Wildfire Risk to Communities: Spatial datasets of landscape-wide wildfire risk components for the United States. BP represents the annual probability of wildfire burning in a specific location. It is referred to as Wildfire Likelihood in the Wildfire Risk to Communities web application. Vegetation and wildland fuels data from LANDFIRE 2014 (version 1.4.0) form the foundation for the Wildfire Risk to Communities data. As such, the data presented here reflect landscape conditions as of the end of 2014. National wildfire hazard datasets of annual burn probability and fire intensity were generated from the LANDFIRE 2014 data by the USDA Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station (Short et al. 2020) using the large fire simulation system (FSim). These national datasets produced with FSim have a relatively coarse cell size of 270 meters (m). To bring these datasets down to a finer resolution more useful for assessing hazard and risk to communities, we upsampled them to the native 30 m resolution of the LANDFIRE fuel and vegetation data. In this upsampling process, we also spread values of modeled burn probability and intensity into developed areas represented in LANDFIRE fuels data as non-burnable.�<div><br /></div><div>�Additional methodology documentation is provided with the data publication download.�<a href='https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/Catalog/RDS-2020-0016' target='_blank' rel='nofollow ugc noopener noreferrer'>Metadata and Downloads.</a></div><div><br /></div><div><b>Note:�</b>Pixel values in this image service have been altered from the original raster dataset due to data requirements in web services.

Wildfire Risk to Communities Conditional Risk To Potential Structures (Image Service),"This dataset is the Conditional Risk to Potential Structures (CRPS) for the United States. It is part of the Wildfire Risk to Communities: Spatial datasets of landscape-wide wildfire risk components for the United States. CRPS represents the potential consequences of fire to a home at a given location, if a fire occurs there and if a home were located there. It is a measure that integrates wildfire intensity with generalized consequences to a home on every pixel, but does not account for the actual probability of fire occurrence. The values in this dataset are multiplied by burn probability to generate the Risk to Potential Structures metric.

Wildfire Risk to Communities Flame Length Exceedance Probability - 4 foot (Image Service),"This dataset is the Flame Length Exceedance Probability - 4 foot (FLEP4) raster for the United States. It is part of the Wildfire Risk to Communities: Spatial datasets of landscape-wide wildfire risk components for the United States. The values of FLEP4 represent the probability of having flame lengths greater than 4 feet if a fire occurs. FLEP4 indicates the potential for moderate to high wildfire intensity. Because 4 feet is considered the limit of manual fire control, FLEP4 represents the likelihood that fire intensity will be beyond the ability of hand crews to control.

Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO-30) Database for the Conterminous United States - 30 meter,"This dataset is called the Gridded SSURGO (gSSURGO) Database and is derived from the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database. SSURGO is generally the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) in accordance with NCSS mapping standards. The tabular data represent the soil attributes, and are derived from properties and characteristics stored in the National Soil Information System (NASIS). The gSSURGO data were prepared by merging traditional SSURGO digital vector map and tabular data into a Conterminous US-wide extent, and adding a Conterminous US-wide gridded map layer derived from the vector, plus a new value added look up (valu) table containing ""ready to map"" attributes. The gridded map layer is offered in an ArcGIS file geodatabase raster format.

The raster and vector map data have a Conterminous US-wide extent. The raster map data have a 30 meter cell size. Each cell (and polygon) is linked to a map unit identifier called the map unit key. A unique map unit key is used to link to raster cells and polygons to attribute tables, including the new value added look up (valu) table that contains additional derived data.

The value added look up (valu) table contains attribute data summarized to the map unit level using best practice generalization methods intended to meet the needs of most users. The generalization methods include map unit component weighted averages and percent of the map unit meeting a given criteria.

The Gridded SSURGO dataset was created for use in national, regional, and state-wide resource planning and analysis of soils data. The raster map layer data can be readily combined with other national, regional, and local raster layers, e.g., National Land Cover Database (NLCD), the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Crop Data Layer, or the National Elevation Dataset (NED).",Natural Resources Conservation Service,Soils Hotline,mailto:SoilsHotline@usda.gov,2022-12-07,https://nrcs.app.box.com/v/soils/folder/17971946225,text/html,public

Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA),"The MLRA Geographic Database was prepared for Agriculture Handbook 296 re-publication and is used to support decisions about regional and national agricultural issues. The database and AH 296 help to identify the need for research and resource inventories. The handbook serves as the vehicle for extrapolating the results of research across political boundaries and is the basis for organizing and operating natural resource conservation programs. Today, USDA soil survey offices are organized to serve groups of the major land resource areas defined in this handbook. The handbook was first published in 1965 as an expansion of the 1950 map entitled “Problem Areas in Soil Conservation”,  and was designed primarily for use by the Soil Conservation Service. The handbook was updated in 1978, and the second edition was printed in 1981. The third edition was published in 2006. The 2022 publication is the fourth edition.",Natural Resources Conservation Service,Soils Hotline,mailto:soilshotline@usda.gov,2022-12-07,https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/resources/data-and-reports/major-land-resource-area-mlra,text/html,public
NCSS Soil Characterization Database,"The National Cooperative Soil Survey - Soil Characterization Database (NCSS-SCD) contains laboratory data for more than 65,000 locations (i.e. xy coordinates) throughout the United States and its Territories, and about 2,100 locations from other countries. It is a compilation of data from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL) and several cooperating laboratories. The data steward and distributor is the National Soil Survey Center (NSSC). Information contained within the database includes physical, chemical, biological, mineralogical, morphological, and mid infrared reflectance (MIR) soil measurements, as well a collection of calculated values. The intended use of the data is to support interpretations related to soil use and management.

Data Usage
Access to the data is provided via the following user interfaces:
1. Interactive Web Map
2. Lab Data Mart (LDM) for querying data and generating reports
3. Soil Data Access (SDA) web services for querying data
5. Direct download of the entire database in several formats

Data at each location includes measurements at multiple depths (e.g. soil horizons). However, not all analyses have been conducted for each location and depth. Typically, a suite of measurements was collected based upon assumed or known conditions regarding the soil being analyzed. For example, soils of arid environments are routinely analyzed for salts and carbonates as part of the standard analysis suite. Standard morphological soil descriptions are available for about 60,000 of these locations. Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy is available for about 7,000 locations. Soil fertility measurements, such as those made by Agricultural Experiment Stations, were not made. Most of the data were obtained over the last 40 years, with about 4,000 locations before 1960, 25,000 from 1960-1990, 27,000 from 1990-2010, and 13,000 from 2010 to 2021. Generally, the number of measurements recorded per location has increased over time. Typically, the data were collected to represent a soil series or map unit component concept. They may also have been sampled to determine the range of variation within a given landscape.

Although strict quality-control measures are applied, the NSSC does not warrant that the data are error free. Also, in some cases the measurements are not within the applicability range of the laboratory methods. For example, dispersion of clay is incomplete in some soils by the standard method used for determining particle-size distribution. Soils producing incomplete dispersion include those that are derived from volcanic materials or that have a high content of iron oxides, gypsum, carbonates, or other cementing materials. Also note that determination of clay minerals by x-ray diffraction is relative. Measurements of very high or very low quantities by any method are not very precise. Other measurements have other limitations in some kinds of soils. Such data are retained in the database for research purposes. Also, some of the data for were obtained from cooperating laboratories within the NCSS. The accuracy of the location coordinates has not been quantified but can be inferred from the precision of their decimal degrees and the presence of a map datum. Some older records may correspond to a county centroid. When the map datum is missing it can be assumed that data prior to 1990 was recorded using NAD27 and with WGS84 after 1995.

For detailed information about methods used in the KSSL and other laboratories refer to ""Soil Survey Investigation Report No. 42"". For information on the application of laboratory data, refer to ""Soil Survey Investigation Report No. 45"".

U.S. General Soil Map (STATSGO2),"This dataset consists of general soil association units. It was developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey and supersedes the State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) dataset published in 1994. It consists of a broad based inventory of soils and non-soil areas that occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped of 1:250,000 in the continental U.S., Hawaii, Puerto, and the Virgin Islands and 1:1,000,000 in Alaska. The dataset was created by generalizing more detailed soil survey maps. Where more detailed soil survey maps were not available, data on geology, topography, vegetation, and climate were assembled, together with Land Remote Sensing Satellite (LANDSAT) images. Soils of like areas were studied, and the probable classification and extent of the soils were determined.

Map unit composition was determined by transecting or sampling areas on the more detailed maps and expanding the data statistically to characterize the entire map unit.

This dataset consists of georeferenced vector digital data and tabular digital data. The map data were collected in 1- by 2-degree topographic quadrangle units and merged into a seamless national dataset. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information system relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.  

These data provide information about soil features on or near the surface of the Earth. Data were collected as part of the National Cooperative Soil Survey.
